               response (IR) traits of Holstein cattle on a national scale and
               to associate estimated breeding values of CMIR, AMIR, and overall
               IR with routinely evaluated traits in Canada. In collaboration
               with the Canadian Bovine Mastitis Research Network, 445 Holstein
               cows from 42 herds across Canada were immunized to measure
               delayed-type hypersensitivity as an indicator of CMIR and serum
               antibody for AMIR to putative type 1 and type 2 test antigens,
               respectively. Primary (d 14) and secondary (d 21) AMIR were
               measured for both IgG1 and IgG2. A series of uni- and bivariate
               linear animal models were used to estimate genetic parameters and
               breeding values for CMIR and the 4 AMIR traits. The models
               included the fixed effects of parity and stage of lactation and
               the random effects of herd-technician, animal, and residual.
               Heritability of CMIR was 0.19 (SE=0.10) and for AMIR traits
               ranged from 0.16 to 0.41 (SE=0.09-0.11) depending on time and
               antibody isotype. The genetic correlations between CMIR and AMIR
               were negative and ranged from -0.13 to -0.45 (SE=0.32-0.46). The
               results indicate adaptive immune response traits are moderately
               heritable and provide a potential for genetic selection. The
               negative genetic correlations between CMIR and AMIR indicate the
               importance of considering both traits in breeding for overall
               disease resistance. Significant beneficial associations between
               the reproductive traits number of services and first service to
               conception were found, which may indicate these reproductive
               traits would improve with genetic selection for enhanced immune
               response.",

               heritability of a range of immune traits and their genetic and
               phenotypic correlations with growth performance. We measured
               immune traits on 589 pigs and performance on 1941 pigs from six
               farms, three of which were classified as 'high health status'
               (i.e. specific pathogen-free) and three were of lower health
               status. All pigs were apparently healthy. Immune traits were
               total white blood cells (WBC), and peripheral blood mononuclear
               leucocyte (PBML) subsets positive for CD4, CD8$\alpha$, gamma
               delta ($\gamma$$\delta$) T cell receptor, CD11R1 (natural killer
               cell marker), B cell and monocyte markers at the start and the
               end of standard growth performance tests. At both time points,
               all immune traits were moderately to highly heritable except for
               CD8$\alpha$+ cells. At end of test, heritability estimates (h2)
               ($\pm{}$s.e.) were 0.18 ($\pm{}$0.11) for total WBC count. For
               PBML subset proportions, the heritabilities were 0.52
               ($\pm{}$0.14) for $\gamma$$\delta$ TCR+ cells, 0.62 ($\pm{}$0.14)
               for CD4+ cells, 0.44 ($\pm{}$0.14) for CD11R1+ cells, 0.58
               ($\pm{}$0.14) for B cells and 0.59 ($\pm{}$0.14) for monocytes.
               Farm health status affected the heritabilities for WBC, being
               substantially higher on lower health status farms, but did not
               have consistent effects on heritabilities for the PBML subsets.
               There were significant negative genetic correlations between
               numbers and proportions of various PBML subsets and performance,
               at both start and end of test. In particular, the proportion of
               PBML cells that were CD11R1+ cells, at end of test, was strongly
               correlated with daily gain (rg = -0.72; P < 0.01). There were
               also weaker but significant negative phenotypic correlations
               between PBML subsets measured at end of test and performance, for
               $\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells, CD8$\alpha$+, CD11R1+ cells, B cells
               or monocytes. Phenotypic correlations with daily gain were
               generally lower at the start of test than at the end of test.
               These results show that most of the major pig PBML subsets are
               heritable, and that systemic levels of several of these PBML
               subsets are genetically negatively correlated with performance.
               This approach provides a basis for using immune trait markers
               when selecting boars that can produce higher-performing progeny.",

               is based on a new model - the ``Sum of Single Effects'' (SuSiE)
               model - which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression
               coefficients as a sum of ``single-effect'' vectors, each with one
               non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting
               procedure - Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) - which
               is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares
               the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise
               methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step,
               IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures
               uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal
               justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it
               optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior
               distribution under the SuSiE model. Further, this approximate
               posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel
               summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a
               Credible Set of variables for each selection. Our methods are
               particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly
               correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are
               characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We

               alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss the

               consequence of differential exposure to parasites. Because
               life-history strategies change sex specifically during the annual
               cycle, immunological responses of the host aiming to reduce the
               impact of parasites may be sexually dimorphic. Despite the great
               complexity of the immune system, studies on immunoecology

               often overlooking potentially important seasonal and gender
               effects. However, because of the differences in physiological and

               variables showed a significant life cycle stage \texttimes{} sex
               interaction. The difference in immune response between the sexes
               was significant in five immune variables during the mating stage,
               when females had consistently stronger immune function than
               males, while variables varied generally non-significantly with
               sex during the remaining three life cycle stages. Our results
               show that the immune system is highly variable between life cycle
               stages and sexes, highlighting the potential fine tuning of the
               immune system to specific physiological states and environmental

               technology. It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to

               To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads
               to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a
               single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion

               practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per
               sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding
               of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments.

               to establish a full set of sequences transcribed on the lateral

               whole-genomic profile of transcription along the entire length of
               all lampbrush chromosomes in the chicken karyotype including sex
               chromosomes and dot chromosomes was obtained. For that, we
               performed RNA-seq of oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic total RNA,
               poly(A) RNA and small RNA libraries and aligned expressed RNA
               sequences against the chicken genome. This led to the
               identification of a full spectrum of maternal RNAs that
               accumulate in the nucleus and cytoplasm of chicken oocytes at the
               lampbrush chromosome stage, are then transferred to the zygote
               and can be used during the early stages of embryogenesis,
               including transcripts of protein-coding genes, long non-coding
               RNAs and small housekeeping non-coding RNAs. We also present the
               first high-throughput transcriptome characterisation of miRNAs
               and piRNAs in chicken oocytes at the lampbrush chromosome stage.
               Major targets of predicted piRNAs include CR1 and LTR containing
               retrotransposable elements. Transcription of tandem repeat arrays
               including 41bp higher-order repeats as well as unique centromere
               sequences was demonstrated by alignment against the whole
               telomere-to-telomere chromosome assemblies. We show that
               transcription of telomere-derived RNAs, including telomeric
               repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and subtelomeric repeat-containing
               RNA, is initiated at adjacent LTR elements. With nuclear RNA-seq,
               we obtained information about a wider set of transcripts,
               including long non-coding RNAs retained in the nucleus and stable
               intronic sequence RNAs (sisRNAs). We identified 5\textquoteright
               UTR sisRNAs that may potentially support host gene transcription
               both during oogenesis and after activation of the embryonic
               genome. For a number of protein-coding genes, we visualised
               nascent transcripts and demonstrated their co-transcriptional
               splicing on the lateral loops of lampbrush chromosomes by
               RNA-FISH. The nuclear RNA-seq profile predicted the
               chromomere-loop organisation of the genomic regions. During
               oocyte maturation, transcriptional unit boundaries were
               maintained, while transcriptional output tended to decrease. We
               conclude that cytoplasmic and nuclear transcripts emerge from
               nascent transcripts on the lateral loops of lampbrush
               chromosomes. Most of gene transcripts are initiated at promoters,
               normally spliced, terminated and polyadenylated. The set of genes

              preserving basic functions of sperm while acquiring new traits
              ensuring advantages in competition over fertilization of female
              gametes. In species with XY sex chromosomes, the outcome of this
              trade-off is found to vary across the stages of spermatogenesis
              but remains unexplored for species with ZW sex chromosomes. Here
              we characterize avian spermatogenesis at single cell resolution
              from testis of collared and pied flycatchers. We find evidence for
              relaxed evolutionary constraint of genes expressed in spermatocyte
              cells going through meiosis. An overrepresentation of Z-linked
              differentially expressed genes between the two species at this

               probabilities for all animals in the pedigree and for all
               genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) provides a
               framework to combine all pedigree, genomic, and phenotypic
               information into a single-stage genomic evaluation. METHODS: An
               algorithm was developed for imputation of genotypes in pedigreed
               populations that allows imputation for completely ungenotyped
               animals and for low-density genotyped animals, accommodates a
               wide variety of pedigree structures for genotyped animals,
               imputes unmapped SNP, and works for large datasets. The method
               involves simple phasing rules, long-range phasing and haplotype
               library imputation and segregation analysis. RESULTS: Imputation
               accuracy was high and computational cost was feasible for
               datasets with pedigrees of up to 25 000 animals. The resulting
               single-stage genomic evaluation increased the accuracy of
               estimated genomic breeding values compared to a scenario in which
               phenotypes on relatives that were not genotyped were ignored.
               CONCLUSIONS: The developed imputation algorithm and software and
               the resulting single-stage genomic evaluation method provide
               powerful new ways to exploit imputation and to obtain more

               evolution is extensively debated. Recent developments in
               population genomics allow inferring rates of adaptive mutations
               by fitting a distribution of fitness effects to the observed
               patterns of polymorphism and divergence at sites under selection
               and sites assumed to evolve neutrally. Here, we summarize the
               current state-of-the-art of these methods and review the factors
               that affect the molecular rate of adaptation. Several studies
               have reported extensive cross-species variation in the proportion
               of adaptive amino-acid substitutions ($\alpha$) and predicted
               that species with larger effective population sizes undergo less
               genetic drift and higher rates of adaptation. Disentangling the
               rates of positive and negative selection, however, revealed that
               mutations with deleterious effects are the main driver of this
               population size effect and that adaptive substitution rates vary
               comparatively little across species. Conversely, rates of
               adaptive substitution have been documented to vary substantially
               within genomes. On a genome-wide scale, gene density,
               recombination and mutation rate were observed to play a role in
               shaping molecular rates of adaptation, as predicted under models

               the gene functional category and the macromolecular structure
               substantially impact the rate of adaptive mutations. Here, we

              Despite its fundamental role, the evolutionary dynamics of
              recombination rates remain largely elusive. The domestication of
              animals, characterized by dynamic selective pressures, provides a
              unique lens through which to investigate these phenomena. Here, we
              constructed a fine-scale recombination map using whole-genome data
              from domestic chickens, including both contemporary commercial
              breeds and their wild progenitor, the Red Junglefowl (RJF). Our
              analysis reveals a rapid evolution of the recombination landscape
              within and between chicken populations, and we find that the
              average recombination rate decreased during chicken domestication.
              Remarkably, this trend is further corroborated by re-analysis of
              the genomes of several domestic species including ducks, goats,
              pigs, and sheep. Contrary to the hypothesis that domestication
              leads to an increase in recombination rates, our results provide
              no support for such a scenario. We suggest that a low
              recombination rate is beneficial for maintaining uniform and
              stable phenotypes in domestic breeds during selective inbreeding.
              Furthermore, we find significant variation in recombination
              hotspots across chicken populations, which is particularly
              pronounced in commercial breeds despite their recent divergence.
              The rapid turnover of recombination hotspots and coldspots appears
              to be closely linked to selective sweeps. Interestingly, in
              contrast to prevailing observations in most species, we find that
              long-term selective inbreeding results in a negative correlation
              between recombination rates and the frequency of introgressed
              ancestry from other RJF subspecies. Our results provide insights

               invading, established, and native. We defined the invading

               expected performance of its best progeny, which we call the

               combination of the mean of the cross's progeny and their standard
               deviation. In this study we specify theory to predict a cross's
               progeny standard deviation from QTL results and explore
               analytically and by simulation the variance of that standard

              across individuals and the processes by which it goes awry are
              long-standing goals in human genetics. Current approaches for
              inferring recombination landscapes either rely on population
              genetic patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD)-capturing a

              multi-generation pedigrees, which limits dataset scale and
              availability. Here, we introduce an approach for inferring
              sex-specific recombination landscapes using data from
              preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A). This
              method relies on low-coverage <0.05\texttimes{} whole-genome
              sequencing of in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryo biopsies. To
              overcome the data sparsity, our method exploits its inherent
              relatedness structure, knowledge of haplotypes from external
              population reference panels, as well as the frequent occurrence of
              monosomies in embryos, whereby the remaining chromosome is phased
              by default. Extensive simulations demonstrate our method's high
              accuracy, even at coverages as low as 0.02\texttimes{}. Applying
              this method to PGT-A data from 18,967 embryos, we mapped 70,660
              recombination events with ~150 kbp resolution, replicating

              pericentromeric regions, our data indicate chromosome-specific
              propensities for different mechanisms of meiotic error. Our
              results provide a comprehensive view of the role of aberrant
              meiotic recombination in the origins of human aneuploidies and

              loss of gene functions from one member of the chromosome pair.
              Such characteristics and changes have been widely reviewed, and
              underlie molecular genetic approaches that can detect sex

              proximate mechanisms causing suppressed recombination between sex

              More studies of recently evolved non-recombining sex-determining

               modifiers) expanding the non-recombining sex-linked region (SLR)

               the length of an SLR-expanding inversion, and the presence of
               partially recessive deleterious mutational variation, affect the
               fixation probability of three different classes of inversions:

               been shown to be heritable in several species, and variants
               significantly associated with this trait have been identified.
               Recombination on the sex chromosome has often been ignored in
               these studies although this trait may be particularly interesting
               as it may correspond to a biological process distinct from that
               on autosomes. For instance, recombination in males is restricted
               to the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR). We herein used a large
               cattle pedigree with more than 100,000 genotyped animals to
               improve the genetic map of the X chromosome and to study the

               that of autosomes in males (0.011) but larger than that of
               autosomes in females (0.024). XRR was highly correlated (0.76)
               with global recombination rate (GRR) in females, suggesting that
               both traits might be governed by shared variants. In agreement, a
               set of eleven previously identified variants associated with GRR
               had correlated effects on female XRR (0.86). In males, XRR and

              comprising up to 20,000 individuals genotyped for ~520,000 common

              occur strictly in the telomeric regions, whereas in female meiosis
              crossovers tend to occur closer to the centromeres. However,
              little is known about the genetic control of these patterns and
              how this differs at the individual level. Here, we investigate
              genetic variation in individual measures of recombination in >
              5000 large full-sib families of a Norwegian Atlantic salmon
              breeding population with high-density SNP genotypes. We show that
              females had 1.6 \texttimes{} higher crossover counts (CC) than
              males, with autosomal linkage maps spanning a total of 2174 cM in
              females and 1483 cM in males. However, because of the extreme
              telomeric bias of male crossovers, female recombination is much
              more important for generation of new haplotypes with 8
              \texttimes{} higher intra-chromosomal genetic shuffling than
              males. CC was heritable in females (h2 = 0.11) and males (h2 =
              0.10), and shuffling was also heritable in both sex but with a
              lower heritability in females (h2 = 0.06) than in males (h2 =
              0.11). Inter-sex genetic correlations for both traits were close
              to zero, suggesting that rates and distribution of crossovers are
              genetically distinct traits in males and females, and that there
              is a potential for independent genetic change in both sexes in the
              Atlantic Salmon. Together, these findings give novel insights into
              the genetic architecture of recombination in salmonids and
              contribute to a better understanding of how rates and distribution
              of recombination may evolve in eukaryotes more broadly.",

               dogs, has undergone a series of disrupting mutations in this
               gene, rendering PRDM9 inactive. Given the importance of PRDM9, it
               is of great interest to learn how its absence in the dog genome
               affects patterns of recombination placement. We have used
               genotypes from domestic dog pedigrees to generate sex-specific
               genetic maps of recombination in this species. On a broad scale,
               we find that placement of recombination events in dogs is
               consistent with that in mice and apes, in that the majority of
               recombination occurs toward the telomeres in males, while female
               crossing over is more frequent and evenly spread along
               chromosomes. It has been previously suggested that dog
               recombination is more uniform in distribution than that of

               elevated immediately upstream of the transcription start site and
               around CpG islands, in agreement with previous studies, but that
               this effect is stronger in male dogs. We also found evidence for

               known. Here, we estimate rates of crossovers and gene conversions
               in 22 colonies of the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and 9 colonies of
               the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, using direct sequencing of 299
               haploid drone offspring. We confirm that both species have

               the highly eusocial honeybee than the primitively social
               bumblebee. There are also significant differences in

               approach for mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that

               distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse
               genome. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately
               200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of the fine
               structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We
               determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus
               motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the
               centres of hotspots and have an intrinsic preference to be
               occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that the vast
               majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are

               species from a community. JSDM account for both structuring
               factors (environmental characteristics or gradients, such as
               habitat type or nutrient availability) and potential interactions
               between the species (competition, mutualism, parasitism, etc.),
               which is instrumental in disentangling meaningful ecological
               interactions from mere statistical associations. Modeling the
               dependency between the species is challenging because of the
               count-valued nature of abundance data and most JSDM rely on
               Gaussian latent layer to encode the dependencies between species
               in a covariance matrix. The multivariate Poisson-lognormal (PLN)
               model is one such model, which can be viewed as a multivariate
               mixed Poisson regression model. Inferring such models raises both
               statistical and computational issues, many of which were solved
               in recent contributions using variational techniques and convex
               optimization tools. The PLN model turns out to be a versatile
               framework, within which a variety of analyses can be performed,

               receive at least one 'obligatory crossover' and crossovers are
               prevented from occurring near one another by 'crossover
               interference'. However, the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon
               of crossover interference has remained mostly mysterious. Using
               quantitative super-resolution cytogenetics and mathematical
               modelling, we investigate crossover positioning in the
               Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type, an over-expressor of the
               conserved E3 ligase HEI10, and a hei10 heterozygous line. We show
               that crossover positions can be explained by a predictive,
               diffusion-mediated coarsening model, in which large,
               approximately evenly-spaced HEI10 foci grow at the expense of
               smaller, closely-spaced clusters. We propose this coarsening
               process explains many aspects of Arabidopsis crossover
               positioning, including crossover interference. Consistent with
               this model, we also demonstrate that crossover positioning can be

               with higher and lower dosage leading to weaker and stronger
               crossover interference, respectively. As HEI10 is a conserved
               member of the RING finger protein family that functions in the
               interference-sensitive pathway for crossover formation, we

               review and update evidence for regulation of RAS components by
               pro-inflammatory factors. RECENT FINDINGS: Angiotensin II (Ang
               II), which is produced by RAS, induces vasoconstriction and
               consequent blood pressure elevation. In addition to this direct
               action, chronically elevated Ang II stimulates several
               pathophysiological mechanisms including generation of oxidative
               stress, stimulation of the nervous system, alterations in renal
               hemodynamics, and activation of the immune system. In particular,
               an activated immune system has been shown to contribute to the

               pairing and segregation of chromosomes during human meiosis, the
               rates and placements of events vary markedly among individuals.
               Characterizing this variation and identifying its determinants
               are essential steps in our understanding of the human
               recombination process and its evolution. STUDY DESIGN/RESULTS:
               Using three large sets of European-American pedigrees, we
               examined variation in five recombination phenotypes that capture
               distinct aspects of crossing-over patterns. We found that the
               mean recombination rate in males and females and the historical
               hotspot usage are significantly heritable and are uncorrelated
               with one another. We then conducted a genome-wide association
               study in order to identify loci that influence them. We
               replicated associations of RNF212 with the mean rate in males and
               in females as well as the association of Inversion 17q21.31 with
               the female mean rate. We also replicated the association of PRDM9
               with historical hotspot usage, finding that it explains most of
               the genetic variance in this phenotype. In addition, we
               identified a set of new candidate regions for further validation.
               SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that variation at broad and
               fine scales is largely separable and that, beyond three known
               loci, there is no evidence for common variation with large
               effects on recombination phenotypes.",

               Meiotic crossovers are formed via homologous repair of programmed
               double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although DSBs occur throughout the
               genome, crossover placement is intricately patterned, as observed
               first in early genetic studies by Muller and Sturtevant. Three
               types of patterning events have been identified. Interference,
               first described by Sturtevant in 1915, is a phenomenon in which
               crossovers on the same chromosome do not occur near one another.
               Assurance, initially identified by Owen in 1949, describes the
               phenomenon in which a minimum of one crossover is formed per
               chromosome pair. Suppression, first observed by Beadle in 1932,
               dictates that crossovers do not occur in regions surrounding the
               centromere and telomeres. The mechanisms behind crossover
               patterning remain largely unknown, and key players appear to act
               at all scales, from the DNA level to inter-chromosome
               interactions. There is also considerable overlap between the

               developments in methods used in the field, and our current

               is thus of both fundamental and practical interest to understand

               We observed quantitative variation in total crossover number with

               paradox. Molecular and genetic analysis has shown that crossing
               over initiates at specific sites called hotspots, by a
               recombinational-repair mechanism in which the initiating hotspot
               is replaced by a copy of its homolog. We have used computer
               simulations of large populations to show that this mechanism
               causes active hotspot alleles to be rapidly replaced by inactive
               alleles, which arise by rare mutation and increase by
               recombination-associated conversion. Additional simulations
               solidified the paradox by showing that the known benefits of
               recombination appear inadequate to maintain its mechanism.
               Neither the benefits of accurate segregation nor those of
               recombining flanking genes were sufficient to preserve active
               alleles in the face of conversion. A partial resolution to this
               paradox was obtained by introducing into the model an additional,
               nonmeiotic function for the sites that initiate recombination,
               consistent with the observed association of hotspots with
               functional sites in chromatin. Provided selection for this
               function was sufficiently strong, active hotspots were able to
               persist in spite of frequent conversion to inactive alleles.
               However, this explanation is unsatisfactory for two reasons.
               First, it is unlikely to apply to obligately sexual species,
               because observed crossover frequencies imply maintenance of many
               hotspots per genome, and the viability selection needed to
               preserve these would drive the species to extinction. Second, it
               fails to explain why such a genetically costly mechanism of
               recombination has been maintained over evolutionary time. Thus
               the paradox persists and is likely to be resolved only by
               significant changes to the commonly accepted mechanism of
               crossing over.",

               predisposition to genetic disease. Due to the repetitive nature
               of the PRDM9 zinc finger array, the large-scale sequencing of
               human PRDM9 is challenging. We, therefore, developed a long-read

               PRDM9 allelic diversity in 720 individuals from seven human

               In humans, a zinc-finger protein, PRDM9, is believed to initiate
               recombination in >40\% of hotspots by binding to a specific DNA
               sequence motif. However, the PRDM9 coding sequence is disrupted
               in the dog genome assembly, raising questions regarding the
               nature and control of recombination in dogs. By analyzing the
               sequences of PRDM9 orthologs in a number of dog breeds and
               several carnivores, we show here that this gene was inactivated
               early in canid evolution. We next use patterns of linkage
               disequilibrium using more than 170,000 SNP markers typed in
               almost 500 dogs to estimate the recombination rates in the dog

               recombination rates show good correspondence with an existing

               observed on the fine scale, and we are able to detect over 4000
               recombination hotspots with high confidence. In contrast to human
               hotspots, 40\% of canine hotspots are characterized by a distinct
               peak in GC content. A comparative genomic analysis indicates that
               these peaks are present also as weaker peaks in the panda,
               suggesting that the hotspots have been continually reinforced by
               accelerated and strongly GC biased nucleotide substitutions,
               consistent with the long-term action of biased gene conversion on
               the dog lineage. These results are consistent with the loss of
               PRDM9 in canids, resulting in a greater evolutionary stability of
               recombination hotspots. The genetic determinants of recombination

               methyltransferase, PR domain containing 9 (PRDM9), the product of
               the only known speciation-associated gene in mammals. PRDM9 is
               thought to determine the preferred recombination
               sites--recombination hotspots--through sequence-specific binding
               of its highly polymorphic multi-Zn-finger domain. Nevertheless,
               Prdm9 knockout mice are proficient at initiating recombination.
               Here we map and analyse the genome-wide distribution of
               recombination initiation sites in Prdm9 knockout mice and in two
               mouse strains with different Prdm9 alleles and their F(1) hybrid.

               pseudo-autosomal region (PAR)--the only area of the genome that

               are still observed in Prdm9 knockout mice, and as in wild type,

              by the DNA-binding specificity of the zinc finger array of the
              PRDM9 protein, which is rapidly evolving at residues in contact
              with DNA. Previous models explained this rapid evolution in terms
              of the need to restore PRDM9 binding sites lost to gene conversion
              over time, under the assumption that more PRDM9 binding always
              leads to more DSBs. This assumption, however, does not align with
              current evidence. Recent experimental work indicates that PRDM9
              binding on both homologs facilitates DSB repair, and that the
              absence of sufficient symmetric binding disrupts meiosis. We
              therefore consider an alternative hypothesis: that rapid PRDM9
              evolution is driven by the need to restore symmetric binding
              because of its role in coupling DSB formation and efficient
              repair. To this end, we model the evolution of PRDM9 from first
              principles: from its binding dynamics to the population genetic
              processes that govern the evolution of the zinc finger array and
              its binding sites. We show that the loss of a small number of
              strong binding sites leads to the use of a greater number of
              weaker ones, resulting in a sharp reduction in symmetric binding
              and favoring new PRDM9 alleles that restore the use of a smaller
              set of strong binding sites. This decrease, in turn, drives rapid
              PRDM9 evolutionary turnover. Our results therefore suggest that
              the advantage of new PRDM9 alleles is in limiting the number of
              binding sites used effectively, rather than in increasing net
              PRDM9 binding. By extension, our model suggests that the
              evolutionary advantage of hotspots may have been to increase the

               with each other and with progression through a cell-division
               cycle. Meiotic recombination initiates with formation of
               developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at
               many places across the genome. DSBs are important for successful
               meiosis but are also dangerous lesions that can mutate or kill,
               so cells ensure that DSBs are made only at the right times,
               places, and amounts. This review examines the complex web of
               pathways that accomplish this control. We explore how chromosome
               breakage is integrated with meiotic progression and how feedback
               mechanisms spatially pattern DSB formation and make it
               homeostatic, robust, and error correcting. Common regulatory
               themes recur in different organisms or in different contexts in
               the same organism. We review this evolutionary and mechanistic
               conservation but also highlight where control modules have
               diverged. The framework that emerges helps explain how meiotic
               chromosomes behave as a self-organizing system.",

              chromosome-scale distribution of crossovers have not been
              investigated formally. We fill this gap by synthesizing joint
              information on genetic and physical maps across 62 animal, plant
              and fungal species. Our quantitative analysis reveals a strong and
              taxonomically widespread reduction of the crossover rate in the
              centre of chromosomes relative to their peripheries. We
              demonstrate that this pattern is poorly explained by the position
              of the centromere, but find that the magnitude of the relative
              reduction in the crossover rate in chromosome centres increases
              with chromosome length. That is, long chromosomes often display a
              dramatically low crossover rate in their centre, whereas short
              chromosomes exhibit a relatively homogeneous crossover rate. This
              observation is compatible with a model in which crossover is
              initiated from the chromosome tips, an idea with preliminary
              support from mechanistic investigations of meiotic recombination.
              Consequently, we show that organisms achieve a higher genome-wide
              crossover rate by evolving smaller chromosomes. Summarizing theory

              taxonomically widespread and systematic heterogeneity in crossover
              rate along chromosomes generates predictable broad-scale trends in
              genetic diversity and population differentiation by modifying the

               SUMMARY: Meiosis is essential for the fertility of most
               eukaryotes and its structures and progression are conserved
               across kingdoms. Yet many of its core proteins show evidence of
               rapid or adaptive evolution. What drives the evolution of meiosis
               proteins? How can constrained meiotic processes be modified in
               response to challenges without compromising their essential
               functions? In surveying the literature, we found evidence of two
               especially potent challenges to meiotic chromosome segregation
               that probably necessitate adaptive evolutionary responses:
               whole-genome duplication and abiotic environment, especially
               temperature. Evolutionary solutions to both kinds of challenge
               are likely to involve modification of homologous recombination
               and synapsis, probably via adjustments of core structural
               components important in meiosis I. Synthesizing these findings
               with broader patterns of meiosis gene evolution suggests that the
               structural components of meiosis coevolve as adaptive modules
               that may change in primary sequence and function while
               maintaining three-dimensional structures and protein
               interactions. The often sharp divergence of these genes among
               species probably reflects periodic modification of entire
               multiprotein complexes driven by genomic or environmental
               changes. We suggest that the pressures that cause meiosis to
               evolve to maintain fertility may cause pleiotropic alterations of
               global crossover rates. We highlight several important areas for
               future research.",

              event that culminates in the formation of crossovers, which are
              essential for accurate chromosome segregation and create new
              combinations of parental alleles. Thus, meiotic recombination
              underlies both the independent assortment of parental chromosomes
              and genetic linkage. This review highlights the features of
              meiotic recombination that distinguish it from recombinational
              repair in somatic cells, and how the molecular processes of
              meiotic recombination are embedded and interdependent with the
              chromosome structures that characterize meiotic prophase. A more
              in-depth review presents our understanding of how crossover and
              noncrossover pathways of meiotic recombination are differentiated
              and regulated. The final section of this review summarizes the
              studies that have defined defective recombination as a leading
              cause of pregnancy loss and congenital disease in humans.",

              when those studies are conducted at large geographic scales. The
              difficulty arises as genotype frequencies often vary in geographic
              space and across distinct environments. Those large-scale
              variations are known to yield false positives in standard
              association testing approaches. Although several methods alleviate
              this problem, no tools have been proposed to evaluate the power
              that association tests could achieve for a specific study design
              and set of genotypes. Our goal here is to present an R program
              fulfilling this objective, by allowing users to simulate
              phenotypes from observed genotypes and to estimate upper bounds on
              achievable power. The simulation model can incorporate realistic
              features such as population structure and gene-by-environment
              interactions, and the package implements a gold-standard test that
              evaluates power using information on confounders. We illustrated
              the use of the program with example studies based on data for the
              plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Simulated phenotypes were used

              causal variants, and to assess the influence various parameters.
              For the simulated data, the new tests reached performances close
              to the gold-standard test and could be reasonably used with
              measured phenotypes. Power to detect causal variants was
              influenced by the number of variants and by the strength of their
              effect sizes, and specific thresholds were obtained from the
              simulation study. In conclusion, our program provides guidance on

               Hill-Robertson (HR) effects, have been proposed as causes of

               polymorphism and divergence data from the noncrossing over dot

               This chromosome shows reduced levels of silent variability and
               reduced effectiveness of selection. We show that neither model
               fits the data on variability. We propose that, in large genomic

               selection, so that their background selection effects are

               also explains why variability in very large nonrecombining

               of this type can produce an individual selection advantage to

               regions that lack crossing over with the rest of the genome and
               by comparing regions with different rates of crossing over, using
               data on DNA sequence polymorphisms from an African population
               that is geographically close to the putatively ancestral
               population for the species, and on sequence divergence from a

               Overall, the observed patterns suggest that the recombination

               directly related to its effective population size (Ne ), which in
               turn is proportional to the recombination rate if there is strong
               selection across the genome. Based on these expectations, we
               hypothesized that low-recombination regions of the genome, as
               well as sex chromosomes and nonrecombining chromosomes, should
               exhibit lower levels of ILS. We tested this hypothesis in
               phylogenomic datasets from primates, the Drosophila melanogaster
               clade, and the Drosophila simulans clade. In all three cases,
               regions of the genome with low or no recombination showed
               significantly stronger support for the putative species tree,
               although results from the X chromosome differed among clades. Our
               results suggest that recurrent selection is acting in these
               low-recombination regions, such that current levels of diversity
               also reflect past decreases in the effective population size at
               these same loci. The results also demonstrate how considering the
               genomic context of a gene tree can assist in more accurate
               determination of the true species phylogeny, especially in cases
               where a whole-genome phylogeny appears to be an unresolvable
               polytomy.",

               50 years. Initially mapping was done by crossing new mutants with
               linkage testing stocks, a slow and laborious method. In the 1950s
               major mutagenesis experiments led to spin-offs in terms of new
               mutants, new knowledge of phenomena including sex determination
               and X-chromosome inactivation, and further understanding of the
               t-complex. The 1970s saw the development of recombinant inbred
               (RI) strains and the use of biochemical variants for mapping. In
               addition the linkage groups were assigned to chromosomes.
               Techniques of embryo surgery were developed, leading to work with
               embryonic stem (ES) cells and hence to the identification of gene
               functioning by knockouts and transgenesis. Another major advance
               in the 1970s and 1980s was the beginning of comparative mapping,
               which is now so important. With the advent of DNA technology,
               progress in mapping increased considerably. Progress became even

               development of microsatellite markers. The completion of the

               melanogaster linkage map. These results were compared with
               results of two other studies that estimated regional
               recombination rates in D. melanogaster using both physical and
               genetic maps. The three methods were largely concordant in
               identifying large-scale genomic patterns of recombination. The
               marker density method was then applied to the Mus musculus
               microsatellite linkage map. The distribution of microsatellites
               provided evidence for heterogeneity in recombination rates.
               Centromeric regions for several mouse chromosomes had
               significantly greater numbers of markers than expected,

               reproductive isolation appears more and more like a common
               phenomenon. Indeed, speciation genomic studies have now
               extensively shown that many species' genomes have hybrid
               ancestry. However, genomic patterns of introgression are often
               heterogeneous across the genome. In many organisms, a positive
               correlation between introgression levels and recombination rate
               has been observed. It is usually explained by the purging of
               deleterious introgressed material due to incompatibilities.
               However, the opposite relationship was observed in a North
               American population of Drosophila melanogaster with admixed
               European and African ancestry. In order to explore how
               directional and epistatic selection can impact the relationship

               far to quantify the overall impact of HRi on the rate of adaptive

               much HRi impedes the rate of adaptive evolution in the coding
               genome of Drosophila melanogaster. We compiled a data set of
               6,141 autosomal protein-coding genes from Drosophila, from which
               polymorphism levels in D. melanogaster and divergence out to D.
               yakuba were estimated. The rate of adaptive evolution was
               calculated using a derivative of the McDonald-Kreitman test that
               controls for slightly deleterious mutations. We find that the
               rate of adaptive amino acid substitution at a given position of

               recombination and the mutation rate, and negatively correlated to
               the gene density of the region. These correlations are robust to
               controlling for each other, for synonymous codon bias and for
               gene functions related to immune response and testes. We show
               that HRi diminishes the rate of adaptive evolution by
               approximately 27\%. Interestingly, genes with low mutation rates
               embedded in gene poor regions lose approximately 17\% of their
               adaptive substitutions whereas genes with high mutation rates
               embedded in gene rich regions lose approximately 60\%. We

              Previous experimental studies of microbial evolution have focused
              primarily on initially clonal populations, finding that adaptation
              is characterized by new strongly selected beneficial mutations

              diverse outcrossed yeast populations, tracking the rate and
              genetic basis of adaptation over time. We combine time-serial
              measurements of fitness and allele frequency changes in 18
              populations of budding yeast evolved at different outcrossing
              rates to infer the drivers of adaptation on standing genetic
              variation. In contrast to initially clonal populations, we find
              that adaptation is driven by a large number of weakly selected,
              linked variants. Populations undergoing different rates of
              outcrossing make use of this selected variation differently:
              whereas asexual populations evolve via rapid, inefficient, and
              highly variable fixation of clones, sexual populations adapt
              continuously by gradually breaking down linkage disequilibrium

              recombination can sustain adaptation over long timescales by
              inducing a transition from selection on genotypes to selection on

               Biased gene conversion in favor of alleles that locally disrupt

               the extent of PRDM9 diversity in natural house mouse populations,
               determine the phylogeography of PRDM9 at a local and global scale
               based on a new measure of pairwise genetic divergence, and

               a result that is contrary to the expectations of reduced

               during gamete production. Such studies have been hampered by the
               absence of a direct measure of this quantity. Existing measures
               consider crossing-over by simply counting the average number of
               crossovers per meiosis. This is qualitatively inadequate, because
               the positions of crossovers along a chromosome are also critical:
               a crossover toward the middle of a chromosome causes more
               shuffling than a crossover toward the tip. Moreover, traditional
               measures fail to consider shuffling from independent assortment
               of homologous chromosomes (Mendel's second law). Here, we present
               a rigorous measure of genome-wide shuffling that does not suffer
               from these limitations. We define the parameter [Formula: see
               text] as the probability that the alleles at two randomly chosen
               loci are shuffled during gamete production. This measure can be
               decomposed into separate contributions from crossover number and
               position and from independent assortment. Intrinsic implications

               larger when crossovers are more evenly spaced, which suggests a
               selective advantage of crossover interference. Utilization of
               [Formula: see text] is enabled by powerful emergent methods for

              chromosome is regressed on the size of the chromosome. First
              developed for humans, this has now been repeatedly used in other
              species, but there has been no evaluation of the suitability of

              say more about phenotypic patterns than the genetic patterns of
              interest. An additional problem is that BLUPs are point estimates
              of quantities that are usually known with little certainty.
              Failure to account for this uncertainty in subsequent tests can
              lead to both bias and extreme anticonservatism. We demonstrate
              that restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian solutions exist
              for these problems and show how unbiased and powerful tests can be
              derived that adequately quantify uncertainty. Of particular
              utility is a new test for detecting evolutionary change that not
              only accounts for prediction error in breeding values but also
              accounts for drift. To illustrate the problem, we apply these
              tests to long-term data on the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and the
              great tit (Parus major) and show that previously reported temporal
              trends in breeding values are not supported.",

               when this process actually begins, but it seems that, at least
               for some species, the initial steps occur at a very early stage
               of development. In recent years, a number of model systems,

                   causes of phenotypic diversity in nature. Most traits of
                   interest, such as those relating to morphology, life-history,
                   immunity and behaviour are quantitative, and phenotypic
                   variation is driven by the cumulative effects of genetic and
                   environmental variation. The field of quantitative genetics
                   aims to quantify the genetic component of this trait variance
                   (i.e. the ``heritability''), often with the assumption that
                   it is driven by many loci of infinitesimal effect throughout
                   the genome. This approach allows us to understand the
                   evolutionary potential of natural populations, and can be
                   extended to examine the genetic covariation with fitness to
                   predict responses to selection. Therefore, quantitative
                   genetic studies are fundamental to understanding evolution in
                   the wild. Over the last two decades, there has been a wealth
                   of quantitative genetic studies investigating trait
                   heritabilities and genetic correlations, but these studies
                   were initially limited to long-term studies of pedigreed
                   populations, or common-garden experiments in organisms more
                   suited to crossing and rearing in a controlled environment.
                   However, the advent of tractable genomics has since allowed
                   quantitative genetic studies to be conducted in a more
                   diverse range of wild systems, and has increased the
                   opportunities for addressing outstanding questions in ecology

               and weaponry through the advantage they confer for access to
               females. Few studies have explored potential trade-offs of
               investment in secondary sexual traits between different
               components of fitness or tested for sexually antagonistic
               selection pressures. These factors may provide explanations for
               observed polymorphisms in both form and quality of secondary
               sexual traits. We report here an analysis of selection on horn
               phenotype in a feral population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the
               island of Hirta, St. Kilda, Scotland. Soay sheep display a
               phenotypic polymorphism for horn type with males growing either
               normal or reduced (scurred) horns, and females growing either
               normal, scurred, or no (polled) horns; further variation in size
               exists within horn morphs. We show that horn phenotype and the
               size of the trait displayed is subject to different selection
               pressures in males and females, generating sexually antagonistic
               selection. Furthermore, there was evidence of a trade-off between
               breeding success and longevity in normal-horned males, with both
               the normal horn type and larger horn size being associated with
               greater annual breeding success but reduced longevity. Therefore,
               selection through lifetime breeding success was not found to act
               upon horn phenotype in males. In females, a negative association
               of annual breeding success within the normal-horned phenotype did
               not result in a significant difference in lifetime fitness when
               compared to scurred individuals, as no significant difference in
               longevity was found. However, increased horn size within this
               group was negatively associated with breeding success and
               longevity. Females without horns (polled) suffered reduced
               longevity and thus reduced lifetime breeding success relative the
               other horn morphs. Our results therefore suggest that trade-offs
               between different components of fitness and antagonistic
               selection between the sexes may maintain genetic variation for

               pattern of heterochiasmy has also been observed in modern linkage
               mapping studies. Several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon
               have been offered, ranging from strictly biological mechanisms
               related to the gametic differences between the sexes, to more
               evolutionary models based on sexually antagonistic selection.
               However, despite the long history of interest in heterochiasmy,
               empirical data has failed to support any theory or pattern
               consistently. Here I test two alternative evolutionary hypotheses
               regarding heterochiasmy across the eutherian mammals, and show
               that sexual dimorphism, but not sperm competition, is strongly
               correlated with recombination rate, suggesting that sexual
               antagonism is an important influence. However, the observed
               relationship between heterochiasmy and sexual dimorphism runs
               counter to theoretical predictions, with male recombination
               higher in species with high levels of sexual dimorphism. This may
               be the response to male-biased dispersal, which, rather than the
               static male fitness landscape envisioned in the models tested
               here, could radically shift optimal male fitness parameters among
               generations.",

              typically one to three exchange points per chromosome pair. Recent

              W, et al. (2012) Science 336:1588-1590], RECQ4

              11:e1005369]. Here we analyzed recombination in plants in which
              one, two, or all three of these pathways were disrupted in both
              pure line and hybrid contexts. The greatest effect was observed
              when combining recq4 and figl1 mutations, which increased the
              hybrid genetic map length from 389 to 3,037 cM. This corresponds
              to an unprecedented 7.8-fold increase in crossover frequency.
              Disrupting the three pathways did not further increase
              recombination, suggesting that some upper limit had been reached.
              The increase in crossovers is not uniform along chromosomes and
              rises from centromere to telomere. Finally, although in wild type
              recombination is much higher in male meiosis than in female
              meiosis (490 cM vs. 290 cM), female recombination is higher than
              male recombination in recq4 figl1 (3,200 cM vs. 2,720 cM),
              suggesting that the factors that make wild-type female meiosis
              less recombinogenic than male wild-type meiosis do not apply in
              the mutant context. The massive increase in recombination observed

              recombination to enhance plant breeding efficiency.",

              role of genetic variation in shaping the recombination landscape.
              We obtained high-density genotype data from [Formula: see text] DO

              median size of 28 kb. The resulting sex-averaged genetic map of
              the DO population is highly concordant with large-scale (order 10
              Mb) features of previously reported genetic maps for mouse. To
              examine fine-scale (order 10 kb) patterns of recombination in the
              DO, we overlaid putative recombination hotspots onto our CO
              intervals. We found that CO intervals are enriched in hotspots
              compared to the genomic background. However, as many as [Formula:

              suggesting that our understanding of hotspots is incomplete. We
              also identified coldspots encompassing 329 Mb, or [Formula: see

              in size, and widely scattered throughout the genome, coldspots
              have a median size of 2.1 Mb and are spatially clustered.
              Coldspots are strongly associated with copy-number variant (CNV)

              whole-genome sequencing of 228 DO mice. Genes in these regions

              recombination by altering chromatin structure in meiosis. Our
              findings demonstrate how multiparent populations, by bridging the

               structure, as well as external environmental stimuli like
               temperature and overall stress. In this work, we focused on the
               genomic landscapes of recombination in a collection of 916 rye
               (Secale cereale) individuals. By analysing population structure

               be short-lived in evolutionary time due to their self-destructive
               nature, as gene conversion favors recombination-suppressing
               alleles over recombination-promoting alleles during double-strand

               highly dynamic, with little correspondence in location between
               humans and chimpanzees. Here, we identify recombination hotspots
               in two lineages of the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus, and compare
               their locations to those found previously in Saccharomyces

               major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian
               genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the
               isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this
               structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of
               neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We
               show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is
               strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and
               positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47\%). This
               demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on
               substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of
               GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more
               strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules
               out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This
               effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the
               neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within
               recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this
               model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in
               the human genome. This model notably explains the positive
               correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate.
               Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population
               size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong
               impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore,
               recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots.
               This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions.
               We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and
               drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution.
               Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of
               crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and
               according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density

              elements (TEs) and meiotic recombination rates. While this is a
              highly recurring feature of eukaryotic genomes, the mechanisms
              driving correlations between TEs and recombination remain poorly
              understood, and distinguishing cause versus effect is challenging.
              Here, we review the evidence for a relation between TEs and
              recombination, and discuss the underlying evolutionary forces.
              Evidence to date suggests that overall TE densities correlate
              negatively with recombination, but the strength of this
              correlation varies across element types, and the pattern can be
              reversed. Results suggest that heterogeneity in the strength of
              selection against ectopic recombination and gene disruption can
              drive TE accumulation in regions of low recombination, but there
              is also strong evidence that the regulation of TEs can influence
              local recombination rates. We hypothesize that TE insertion
              polymorphism may be important in driving within-species variation
              in recombination rates in surrounding genomic regions.
              Furthermore, the interaction between TEs and recombination may
              create positive feedback, whereby TE accumulation in
              non-recombining regions contributes to the spread of recombination
              suppression. Further investigation of the coevolution between
              recombination and TEs has important implications for our
              understanding of the evolution of recombination rates and genome

               female meiotic drivers--alleles that increase in frequency by
               exploiting the asymmetric cell division of oogenesis--present a
               potent selective pressure favoring the modification of the female

               shaping patterns of variation within and among dyads, modifiers

               male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma since the
               early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been put forward to
               explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact
               has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in
               one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the
               Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on
               autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex
               chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate
               species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both
               sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply
               to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic
               plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is
               due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not
               influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This
               finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a
               population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy
               and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.",

               evolved 25--30 times, is always restricted to the heterogametic
               sex in dioecious species, usually the male. Here we collate data
               on quantitative sex differences in chiasma frequency from 54
               species (4 hermaphroditic flatworms, 18 dioecious insects and
               vertebrates and 32 hermaphroditic plants) to test whether similar
               trends hold. Though significant sex differences have been
               observed within many species, only the Liliaceae show a
               significant sexual dimorphism in chiasma frequency across
               species, with more crossing over in embryo mother cells than in
               pollen mother cells; chiasma frequencies are unrelated to sex and
               gamety in all other higher taxa studied. Further, the magnitude
               of sexual dimorphism, independent of sign, does not differ among
               the three main ecological groups (dioecious animals, plants, and
               hermaphroditic animals), contrary to what would be expected if it
               reflected sex-specific selection on recombination. These results
               indicate that the strong trends for achiasmate meiosis do not
               apply to quantitative sex differences in recombination, and
               contradict theories of sex-specific costs and benefits. An
               alternative hypothesis suggests that sex differences may be
               more-or-less neutral, selection determining only the mean rate of
               recombination. While male and female chiasma frequencies are more
               similar than would be expected under complete neutrality, a less
               absolute form of the hypothesis is more difficult to falsify. In
               female mice the sex bivalent has more chiasmata for its length
               than the autosomes, perhaps compensating for the absence of
               recombination in males. Finally, we observe that chiasma
               frequencies in males and females are positively correlated across
               species, validating the use of only one sex in comparative
               studies of recombination.",

               If recombination is to aid selection, there must be negative
               linkage disequilibria-favorable alleles must be found together
               less often than expected by chance. These negative linkage
               disequilibria can be generated directly by selection, but this
               must involve negative epistasis of just the right strength, which
               is not expected, from either experiment or theory. Random drift
               provides a more general source of negative associations:
               Favorable mutations almost always arise on different genomes, and
               negative associations tend to persist, precisely because they
               shield variation from selection. We can understand how
               recombination aids adaptation by determining the maximum possible
               rate of adaptation. With unlinked loci, this rate increases only
               logarithmically with the influx of favorable mutations. With a
               linear genome, a scaling argument shows that in a large
               population, the rate of adaptive substitution depends only on the
               expected rate in the absence of interference, divided by the
               total rate of recombination. A two-locus approximation predicts
               an upper bound on the rate of substitution, proportional to
               recombination rate. If associations between linked loci do impede
               adaptation, there can be substantial selection for modifiers that
               increase recombination. Whether this can account for the
               maintenance of high rates of sex and recombination depends on the
               extent of selection. It is clear that the rate of species-wide
               substitutions is typically far too low to generate appreciable
               selection for recombination. However, local sweeps within a

               patterns of recombination along chromosomes. In the first
               scientific review of this phenomenon, we find that recombination
               is biased toward telomeres in males and more uniformly
               distributed in females in most vertebrates and many other
               eukaryotes. Notable exceptions to this pattern exist, however.
               Fine-scale recombination patterns also frequently differ between
               males and females. The molecular mechanisms responsible for sex
               differences remain unclear, but chromatin landscapes play a role.
               Why these sex differences evolve also is unclear. Hypotheses
               suggest that they may result from sexually antagonistic selection
               acting on coding genes and their regulatory elements, meiotic
               drive in females, selection during the haploid phase of the life
               cycle, selection against aneuploidy, or mechanistic constraints.
               No single hypothesis, however, can adequately explain the

               recombination landscapes have important consequences for

               the genome and between individuals, which may be related to some
               genomic features. The objective of this study was to assess the
               frequency of recombination events and to identify QTL
               (quantitative trait loci) for recombination rate in two purebred
               layer chicken lines. METHODS: A total of 1200 white-egg layers
               (WL) were genotyped with 580 K SNPs and 5108 brown-egg layers
               (BL) were genotyped with 42 K SNPs (single nucleotide
               polymorphisms). Recombination events were identified within
               half-sib families and both the number of recombination events and
               the recombination rate was calculated within each 0.5 Mb window
               of the genome. The 10\% of windows with the highest recombination
               rate on each chromosome were considered to be recombination
               hotspots. A BayesB model was used separately for each line to
               identify genomic regions associated with the genome-wide number
               of recombination event per meiosis. Regions that explained more
               than 0.8\% of genetic variance of recombination rate were
               considered to harbor QTL. RESULTS: Heritability of recombination
               rate was estimated at 0.17 in WL and 0.16 in BL. On average, 11.3
               and 23.2 recombination events were detected per individual across
               the genome in 1301 and 9292 meioses in the WL and BL,
               respectively. The estimated recombination rates differed
               significantly between the lines, which could be due to
               differences in inbreeding levels, and haplotype structures. Dams
               had about 5\% to 20\% higher recombination rates per meiosis than
               sires in both lines. Recombination rate per 0.5 Mb window had a
               strong negative correlation with chromosome size and a strong
               positive correlation with GC content and with CpG island density
               across the genome in both lines. Different QTL for recombination
               rate were identified in the two lines. There were 190 and 199
               non-overlapping recombination hotspots detected in WL and BL
               respectively, 28 of which were common to both lines. CONCLUSIONS:
               Differences in the recombination rates, hotspot locations, and
               QTL regions associated with genome-wide recombination were
               observed between lines, indicating the breed-specific feature of
               detected recombination events and the control of recombination
               events is a complex polygenic trait.",

               studied the patterns of recombination in sheep, using multiple

               in a dairy breed from the south of France (the Lacaune breed) at
               a fine scale by combining meiotic recombination rates from a
               large pedigree genotyped with a 50K SNP array and historical
               recombination rates from a sample of unrelated individuals
               genotyped with a 600K SNP array. This analysis revealed
               recombination patterns in sheep similar to other mammals but also
               genome regions that have likely been affected by directional and
               diversifying selection. We estimated the average recombination
               rate of Lacaune sheep at 1.5 cM/Mb, identified about 50,000
               crossover hotspots on the genome and found a high correlation

               genome-wide association study revealed two major loci affecting
               inter-individual variation in recombination rate in Lacaune,
               including the RNF212 and HEI10 genes and possibly two other loci

               recombination maps in Sheep. However, despite their similar

              recombination dynamics in most metazoans. The historical
              recombination maps in birds show an apparent stasis in the
              positioning of recombination events. This highly conserved

               fragments, we uncover a genome-wide DSB map of unprecedented
               resolution and sensitivity. We use this map to explore how DSB
               distribution is influenced by large-scale chromosome structures,
               chromatin, transcription factors, and local sequence composition.
               Our analysis offers mechanistic insight into DSB formation and
               early processing steps, supporting the view that the
               recombination terrain is molded by combinatorial and hierarchical
               interaction of factors that work on widely different size scales.
               This map illuminates the occurrence of DSBs in repetitive DNA
               elements, repair of which can lead to chromosomal rearrangements.

               expression evolves in stabilized hybrid taxa remains an open
               question. As gene expression evolves in a stabilizing manner,

               Here, we address to what extent gonad gene expression has evolved
               in an established and stable homoploid hybrid, the Italian
               sparrow (Passer italiae). Through comparison of gene expression

               Fundamental to meiosis is the process of homologous
               recombination, whereby DNA double-strand breaks are introduced
               into the genome and are subsequently repaired to generate either
               noncrossovers or crossovers. Although homologous recombination is
               essential for chromosome pairing during prophase I, the resulting
               crossovers are critical for maintaining homolog interactions and
               enabling accurate segregation at the first meiotic division.
               Thus, the placement, timing, and frequency of crossover formation
               must be exquisitely controlled. In this review, we discuss the
               proteins involved in crossover formation, the process of their
               formation and designation, and the rules governing crossovers,

               except for human and a few model organisms, it is not well
               studied in livestock, including cattle. RESULTS: To investigate
               their distributions in the cattle sperm genome, we sequenced 143
               single sperms from two Holstein bulls. We mapped meiotic
               recombination events at high resolution based on phased
               heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In the absence
               of evolutionary selection pressure in fertilization and survival,
               recombination events in sperm are enriched near distal
               chromosomal ends, revealing that such a pattern is intrinsic to
               the molecular mechanism of meiosis. Furthermore, we further

               (CO) events are rare, as usually only one or two of them occur

               distributed evenly along chromosomes. In plants with large

               close to chromosome ends, and there are few COs in the large

               interest in engineering CO landscape to improve breeding

               recombination result in progeny genetically distinct from their

               species have almost the same number of recombination nodules per
               genome: 51.4 $\pm{}$ 4.3 in the swift and 51.1 $\pm{}$ 6.7 in the
               hobby. The distribution of the recombination nodules along the
               macrochromosomes was extremely polarized in the Common Swift and
               was rather even in the Eurasian Hobby.ConclusionsThis study adds
               two more species to the short list of birds in which the number
               and distribution of recombination nodules have been examined. Our
               data confirm that recombination rate in birds is substantially
               higher than that in mammals, but shows rather a low interspecies
               variability. Even a substantial reduction in chromosome number
               does not lead to any substantial decrease in recombination rate.
               More data from different taxa are required to draw statistically
               supported conclusions about the evolution of recombination in
               birds.",

              which greatly facilitates the study of chromosome behavior. The
              complex events involved in homolog juxtaposition necessitate
              prolongation of prophase, thus permitting resolution of events

              of homologs includes recombination at the DNA level, which is

              tissue and heterogeneity in cell type abundance between the sexes
              can influence inferred patterns of sex-biased gene expression by
              increasing both the false-positive and false-negative rates.
              Moreover, we show that at the bulk level, the subset of sex-biased
              genes that are the product of sex differences in cell type
              abundance can significantly confound patterns of coding-sequence
              evolution. Taken together, our results offer a unique insight into
              the evolution of sex-biased gene expression and highlight the
              power of single-cell RNA-sequencing in disentangling between genes
              that are a cause as opposed to a consequence of sexual dimorphism.",

               Many organisms--including budding yeast, humans, zebrafish,
               Drosophila, and Arabidopsis--regulate the distribution of
               crossovers, so that, most of the time, each chromosome bundle
               gets at least one crossover while the mean number of crossovers
               per chromosome remains modest. This regulation is obtained
               through crossover interference. Recent evidence suggests that the
               organisms that use recombination functions to achieve synapsis
               have two classes of crossovers, only one of which is subject to
               interference. We statistically test this two-pathway hypothesis

               population genetic methods that infer recombination rates from
               patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the genome have become a
               popular method to estimate rates of recombination. However, these

               simplifying assumptions about the populations of interest that
               are often not met in natural populations. One such assumption is
               the absence of gene flow from other populations. Here, we use

               vertebrates of ecological and evolutionary importance are scarce.
               Therefore, linkage maps with high-density genome coverage are
               needed for progress in genomics of wild species. The Siberian jay
               (Perisoreus infaustus; Corvidae) is a passerine bird which has
               been subject to lots of research in the areas of ecology and
               evolutionary biology. Knowledge of its genome structure and
               organization is required to advance our understanding of the
               genetic basis of ecologically important traits in this species,
               as well as to provide insights into avian genome evolution.
               RESULTS: We describe the first genetic linkage map of Siberian
               jay constructed using 117 microsatellites and a mapping pedigree
               of 349 animals representing five families from a natural
               population breeding in western Finland from the years 1975 to
               2006. Markers were resolved into nine autosomal and a
               Z-chromosome-specific linkage group, 10 markers remaining
               unlinked. The best-position map with the most likely positions of
               all significantly linked loci had a total sex-average size of
               862.8 cM, with an average interval distance of 9.69 cM. The
               female map covered 988.4 cM, whereas the male map covered only
               774 cM. The Z-chromosome linkage group comprised six markers,
               three pseudoautosomal and three sex-specific loci, and spanned
               10.6 cM in females and 48.9 cM in males. Eighty-one of the mapped
               loci could be ordered on a framework map with odds of >1000:1
               covering a total size of 809.6 cM in females and 694.2 cM in
               males. Significant sex specific distortions towards reduced male
               recombination rates were revealed in the entire best-position map
               as well as within two autosomal linkage groups. Comparative
               mapping between Siberian jay and chicken anchored 22 homologous
               loci on 6 different linkage groups corresponding to chicken
               chromosomes Gga1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and Z. Quite a few cases of
               intra-chromosomal rearrangements within the autosomes and three
               cases of inter-chromosomal rearrangement between the Siberian jay
               autosomal linkage groups (LG1, LG2 and LG3) and the chicken sex
               chromosome GgaZ were observed, suggesting a conserved synteny,
               but changes in marker order, within autosomes during about 100
               million years of avian evolution. CONCLUSION: The constructed
               linkage map represents a valuable resource for intraspecific
               genomics of Siberian jay, as well as for avian comparative
               genomic studies. Apart from providing novel insights into
               sex-specific recombination rates and patterns, the described maps
               - from a previously genomically uncharacterized superfamily
               (Corvidae) of passerine birds - provide new insights into avian
               genome evolution. In combination with high-resolution data on
               quantitative trait variability from the study population, they
               also provide a foundation for QTL-mapping studies.",

              Bill morphology is an ecologically important and phenotypically
              variable trait, which is highly heritable and closely linked to
              individual fitness. Thus, bill morphology traits are suitable
              candidates for gene mapping analyses. Previous studies have
              revealed several genes that may influence bill morphology, but the
              similarity of gene and allele effects between species and
              populations is unknown. Here, we develop a custom 200K SNP array
              and use it to examine the genetic basis of bill morphology in 1857
              house sparrow individuals from a large-scale, island
              metapopulation off the coast of Northern Norway. We found high
              genomic heritabilities for bill depth and length, which were
              comparable with previous pedigree estimates. Candidate gene and
              genomewide association analyses yielded six significant loci, four
              of which have previously been associated with craniofacial
              development. Three of these loci are involved in bone morphogenic
              protein (BMP) signalling, suggesting a role for BMP genes in
              regulating bill morphology. However, these loci individually
              explain a small amount of variance. In combination with results
              from genome partitioning analyses, this indicates that bill
              morphology is a polygenic trait. Any studies of eco-evolutionary
              processes in bill morphology are therefore dependent on methods
              that can accommodate polygenic inheritance of the phenotype and
              molecular-scale evolution of genetic architecture.",

               genomic parameter, influencing the efficacy of selection and the
               fate of new mutations. The molecular and evolutionary functions
               of recombination should impose strong selective constraints on
               the range of recombination rates. Yet, variation in recombination
               rate is observed on a variety of genomic and evolutionary scales.
               In the past decade, empirical studies have described variation in
               recombination rate within genomes, between individuals, between
               sexes, between populations and between species. At the same time,
               theoretical work has provided an increasingly detailed picture of
               the evolutionary advantages to recombination. Perhaps
               surprisingly, the causes of natural variation in recombination
               rate remain poorly understood. We argue that empirical and
               theoretical approaches to understand the evolution of
               recombination have proceeded largely independently of each other.
               Most models that address the evolution of recombination rate were
               created to explain the evolutionary advantage of recombination
               rather than quantitative differences in rate among individuals.
               Conversely, most empirical studies aim to describe variation in
               recombination rate, rather than to test evolutionary hypotheses.
               In this Perspective, we argue that efforts to integrate the rich
               bodies of empirical and theoretical work on recombination rate
               are crucial to moving this field forward. We provide new
               directions for the development of theory and the production of

               founder gametes within a pedigree. This approach takes advantage
               of very distant (and unrecorded) relationships, and this greatly
               increases the power of the method, compared with traditional
               pedigree-based linkage analyses. By integrating variance
               contributed by founder gametes in the population, our approach
               provides an estimate of the Regional Heritability attributable to
               a small genomic region (e.g. 100 SNP window covering ca. 1 Mb of
               DNA in a 300000 SNP GWAS) and has the power to detect regions
               containing multiple alleles that individually contribute too
               little variance to be detectable by GWAS as well as regions with
               single common GWAS-detectable SNPs. We use genome-wide SNP array
               data to obtain both a genome-wide relationship matrix and
               regional relationship (``identity by state'' or IBS) matrices for
               sequential regions across the genome. We then estimate a
               heritability for each region sequentially in our genome-wide

               uncovers new loci that explain additional trait variation. We
               analysed data from three Southern European populations and from
               Orkney for exemplar traits - serum uric acid concentration and
               height. We show that regional heritability estimates are
               correlated with results from genome-wide association analysis but
               can capture more of the genetic variance segregating in the

              Here we present BEAST: a fast, flexible software architecture for
              Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an
              evolutionary tree. A large number of popular stochastic models of
              sequence evolution are provided and tree-based models suitable for

              RESULTS: BEAST version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines of Java
              source code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides models for

               offspring. The male manipulation and female choice hypotheses
               predict that age-specific male mating behaviour could explain
               this old-over-young male advantage. These hypotheses have been
               difficult to test because copulations and the individuals
               involved are hard to observe. Here, we studied the mating
               behaviour and pairing contexts of captive house sparrows, Passer
               domesticus. Our set-up mimicked the complex social environment
               experienced by wild house sparrows. We found that middle-aged
               males, which would be considered old in natural populations,
               gained most extra-pair paternity. However, both, female
               solicitation behaviour and subsequent extra-pair matings were not
               associated with male age. Further, copulations were more likely
               when solicited by females than when initiated by males (i.e.
               unsolicited copulations). Male initiated within-pair copulations
               were more common than male initiated extra-pair copulations. To
               conclude, our results did not support either hypothesis regarding
               age-specific male mating behaviour. Instead, female choice,
               independent of male age, governed copulation success, especially
               in an extra-pair context. Post-copulatory mechanisms might
               determine why older males sire more extra-pair offspring.",

               that involves the successive and simultaneous execution of three
               different gene expression programs: mitotic proliferation of
               spermatogonia, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Testicular cell
               heterogeneity has hindered its molecular analyses. Moreover, the
               characterization of short, poorly represented cell stages such as
               initial meiotic prophase ones (leptotene and zygotene) has
               remained elusive, despite their crucial importance for
               understanding the fundamentals of meiosis. RESULTS: We have
               developed a flow cytometry-based approach for obtaining highly
               pure stage-specific spermatogenic cell populations, including
               early meiotic prophase. Here we combined this methodology with
               next generation sequencing, which enabled the analysis of meiotic
               and postmeiotic gene expression signatures in mouse with
               unprecedented reliability. Interestingly, we found that a
               considerable number of genes involved in early as well as late
               meiotic processes are already on at early meiotic prophase, with
               a high proportion of them being expressed only for the short time
               lapse of lepto-zygotene stages. Besides, we observed a massive
               change in gene expression patterns during medium meiotic prophase
               (pachytene) when mostly genes related to spermiogenesis and sperm
               function are already turned on. This indicates that the
               transcriptional switch from meiosis to post-meiosis takes place
               very early, during meiotic prophase, thus disclosing a higher
               incidence of post-transcriptional regulation in spermatogenesis
               than previously reported. Moreover, we found that a good
               proportion of the differential gene expression in spermiogenesis
               corresponds to up-regulation of genes whose expression starts
               earlier, at pachytene stage; this includes transition protein-and
               protamine-coding genes, which have long been claimed to switch on
               during spermiogenesis. In addition, our results afford new
               insights concerning X chromosome meiotic inactivation and
               reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides for the first time
               an overview of the time course for the massive onset and turning
               off of the meiotic and spermiogenic genetic programs.

              found in many eukaryotic centromeres. The assembly of such
              repetitive regions creates a need for their de novo annotation,
              including patterns of higher order repetition. To annotate tandem
              repeats, methods are required that can be widely applied to
              diverse genome sequences, without prior knowledge of monomer
              sequences. RESULTS: Tandem Repeat Annotation and Structural
              Hierarchy (TRASH) is a tool that identifies and maps tandem
              repeats in nucleotide sequence, without prior knowledge of repeat
              composition. TRASH analyses a fasta assembly file, identifies
              regions occupied by repeats and then precisely maps them and their
              higher order structures. To demonstrate the applicability and
              scalability of TRASH for centromere research, we apply our method
              to the recently published Col-CEN genome of Arabidopsis thaliana

               thought to play an important role in cell deterioration with
               advancing age. The observed variation in telomere length among
               individuals of the same age is therefore thought to be related to
               variation in potential longevity. Studies of this relationship
               are hampered by the time scale over which individuals need to be
               followed, particularly in long-lived species where lifespan
               variation is greatest. So far, data are based either on simple
               comparisons of telomere length among different age classes or on
               individuals whose telomere length is measured at most twice and
               whose subsequent survival is monitored for only a short
               proportion of the typical lifespan. Both approaches are subject
               to bias. Key studies, in which telomere length is tracked from
               early in life, and actual lifespan recorded, have been lacking.
               We measured telomere length in zebra finches (n = 99) from the
               nestling stage and at various points thereafter, and recorded
               their natural lifespan (which varied from less than 1 to almost 9
               y). We found telomere length at 25 d to be a very strong
               predictor of realized lifespan (P < 0.001); those individuals
               living longest had relatively long telomeres at all points at
               which they were measured. Reproduction increased adult telomere
               loss, but this effect appeared transient and did not influence
               survival. Our results provide the strongest evidence available of
               the relationship between telomere length and lifespan and
               emphasize the importance of understanding factors that determine

               than in spermatocytes at the pachytene stage of meiosis I, when
               crossing-over takes place. Thus the meiosis-specific pairing
               structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), is considerably longer
               in oocytes in comparison to spermatocytes. The aim of the present
               study was to examine the influence of this length factor on
               meiotic recombination in male and female human germ cells. The
               positions of crossovers were identified by the DNA mismatch
               repair protein MLH1. Spermatocytes have approximately 50
               crossovers per cell in comparison to more than 70 in oocytes.
               Analyses of inter-crossover distances (and presumptively
               crossover interference) along SCs suggested that while there
               might be inter-individual variation, there was no consistent
               difference between sexes. Thus the higher rate of recombination
               in human oocytes is not a consequence of more closely spaced
               crossovers along the SCs. The rate of recombination per unit
               length of SC is higher in spermatocytes than oocytes. However,
               when the so-called obligate chiasma is excluded from the
               analysis, then the rates of recombination per unit length of SC
               are essentially identical in the two sexes. Our analyses indicate
               that the inter-sex difference in recombination is largely a
               consequence of the difference in meiotic chromosome architecture
               in the two sexes. We propose that SC length per se, and therefore
               the size of the physical platform for crossing-over (and not the
               DNA content) is the principal factor determining the difference
               in rate of recombination in male and female germ cells. A
               preliminary investigation of SC loop size by fluorescence in situ
               hybridization (FISH) indicated loops may be shorter in oocytes
               than in spermatocytes.",

               zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which is a songbird belonging

               most important human accomplishments of the last 10,000 yr.
               Though our empirical knowledge of the genetic mechanisms of plant
               domestication is still relatively limited, there exists a large
               body of theory that offers a host of hypotheses on the genetics
               of domestication. Two of these that have not been addressed
               concern the role of recombination in the process of
               domestication. The first predicts an increase in recombination
               rate through domestication, while the second argues that
               recombination rate should serve as a preadaptation to
               domestication. This study makes use of data on chiasma
               frequencies available from almost a century of plant
               cytogenetical literature to test these two hypotheses. The
               results support the hypothesis that domestication selects for an
               increase in recombination, and in rejecting the preadaptation
               hypothesis, they suggest directions for future research into the
               possibility of preadaptation to domestication.",

               their location follows a distinct pattern and is specified by PR

               PRDM9: DNA binding, histone methyltransferase, and interaction
               with other proteins. Remarkably, PRDM9 activity leads to the
               erosion of its own binding sites and the rapid evolution of its
               DNA-binding domain. PRDM9 may also contribute to reproductive

               2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30

               required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base

               computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual
               allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain
               estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic
               relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the
               inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and
               second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors
               converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of

               66\%. Computing times increased linearly with number of

               genetic material between homologous chromosomes. Recombination
               rate varies between different parts of the genome, between
               individuals, and is influenced by genetics. In this paper, we
               assessed the genetic variation in recombination rate along the
               genome and between individuals in the pig using multilocus
               iterative peeling on 150,000 individuals across nine genotyped
               pedigrees. We used these data to estimate the heritability of
               recombination and perform a genome-wide association study of
               recombination in the pig. RESULTS: Our results confirmed known
               features of the recombination landscape of the pig genome,
               including differences in genetic length of chromosomes and marked
               sex differences. The recombination landscape was repeatable
               between lines, but at the same time, there were differences in
               average autosome-wide recombination rate between lines. The
               heritability of autosome-wide recombination rate was low but not
               zero (on average 0.07 for females and 0.05 for males). We found
               six genomic regions that are associated with recombination rate,
               among which five harbour known candidate genes involved in
               recombination: RNF212, SHOC1, SYCP2, MSH4 and HFM1. CONCLUSIONS:
               Our results on the variation in recombination rate in the pig

               low but nonzero heritability, and the identification of a major

               homologous to that detected in several other species. This work

               forces that operate to shape recombination rate and patterns are
               unclear. Domestication offers a unique opportunity to study the
               interplay between recombination and selection. In domesticates,
               intense selection for particular traits is imposed on small

               almost universal in higher animals and plants, its inherent costs
               have made its maintenance difficult to explain. The most famous
               of these is the twofold cost of males, which can greatly reduce
               the fecundity of a sexual population, compared to a population of
               asexual females. Over the past century, multiple hypotheses,
               along with experimental evidence to support these, have been put
               forward to explain widespread costly sex. In this review, we
               outline some of the most prominent theories, along with the
               experimental and observational evidence supporting these.
               Historically, there have been 4 classes of theories: the ability
               of sex to fix multiple novel advantageous mutants (Fisher-Muller
               hypothesis); sex as a mechanism to stop the build-up of
               deleterious mutations in finite populations (Muller's ratchet);
               recombination creating novel genotypes that can resist infection
               by parasites (Red Queen hypothesis); and the ability of sex to
               purge bad genomes if deleterious mutations act synergistically
               (mutational deterministic hypothesis). Current theoretical and
               experimental evidence seems to favor the hypothesis that sex
               breaks down selection interference between new mutants, or it
               acts as a mechanism to shuffle genotypes in order to repel
               parasitic invasion. However, there is still a need to collect
               more data from natural populations and experimental studies,

               based on a mean of 430 informative meioses per SNP. The map was

               little is known about the dynamics of inbreeding depression in

              Australia. To aid its conservation, the population is the subject
              of genetic rescue. To understand, monitor, and modulate the
              effects of genetic rescue on the helmeted honeyeater genome, a
              chromosome-length genome and a high-density linkage map are
              required. RESULTS: We used a combination of Illumina, Oxford
              Nanopore, and Hi-C sequencing technologies to assemble a
              chromosome-length genome of the helmeted honeyeater, comprising
              906 scaffolds, with length of 1.1 Gb and scaffold N50 of 63.8 Mb.
              Annotation comprised 57,181 gene models. Using a pedigree of 257
              birds and 53,111 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we obtained
              high-density linkage and recombination maps for 25 autosomes and Z
              chromosome. The total sex-averaged linkage map was 1,347 cM long,
              with the male map being 6.7\% longer than the female map.
              Recombination maps revealed sexually dimorphic recombination rates
              (overall higher in males), with average recombination rate of 1.8
              cM/Mb. Comparative analyses revealed high synteny of the helmeted
              honeyeater genome with that of 3 passerine species (e.g., 32 Hi-C
              scaffolds mapped to 30 zebra finch autosomes and Z chromosome).
              The genome assembly and linkage map suggest that the helmeted
              honeyeater exhibits a fission of chromosome 1A into 2 chromosomes
              relative to zebra finch. PSMC analysis showed a $\sim{}$15-fold
              decline in effective population size to $\sim{}$60,000 from mid-
              to late Pleistocene. CONCLUSIONS: The annotated chromosome-length

              evolutionary studies and will be fundamental in guiding
              conservation efforts for the helmeted honeyeater.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is an important
              agricultural species that is the second largest contributor to the
              world's poultry meat production. The genomic resources of turkey
              provide turkey breeders with tools needed for the genetic
              improvement of commercial breeds of turkey for economically
              important traits. A linkage map of turkey is essential not only
              for the mapping of quantitative trait loci, but also as a
              framework to enable the assignment of sequence contigs to specific
              chromosomes. Comparative genomics with chicken provides insight
              into mechanisms of genome evolution and helps in identifying rare
              genomic events such as genomic rearrangements and
              duplications/deletions. RESULTS: Eighteen full sib families,
              comprising 1008 (35 F1 and 973 F2) birds, were genotyped for 775
              single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Of the 775 SNPs, 570 were
              informative and used to construct a linkage map in turkey. The
              final map contains 531 markers in 28 linkage groups. The total
              genetic distance covered by these linkage groups is 2,324
              centimorgans (cM) with the largest linkage group (81 loci)
              measuring 326 cM. Average marker interval for all markers across
              the 28 linkage groups is 4.6 cM. Comparative mapping of turkey and
              chicken revealed two inter-, and 57 intrachromosomal
              rearrangements between these two species. CONCLUSION: Our turkey
              genetic map of 531 markers reveals a genome length of 2,324 cM.
              Our linkage map provides an improvement of previously published
              maps because of the more even distribution of the markers and
              because the map is completely based on SNP markers enabling easier
              and faster genotyping assays than the microsatellitemarkers used
              in previous linkage maps. Turkey and chicken are shown to have a
              highly conserved genomic structure with a relatively low number of
              inter-, and intrachromosomal rearrangements.",

              how these events are interacting. To tackle this question, we
              studied the patterns of recombination in sheep, using multiple
              approaches and data sets. We constructed male recombination maps
              in a dairy breed from the south of France (the Lacaune breed) at a
              fine scale by combining meiotic recombination rates from a large
              pedigree genotyped with a 50K SNP array and historical
              recombination rates from a sample of unrelated individuals
              genotyped with a 600K SNP array. This analysis revealed
              recombination patterns in sheep similar to other mammals but also
              genome regions that have likely been affected by directional and
              diversifying selection. We estimated the average recombination
              rate of Lacaune sheep at 1.5 cM/Mb, identified $\sim{}$50,000
              crossover hotspots on the genome, and found a high correlation
              between historical and meiotic recombination rate estimates. A
              genome-wide association study revealed two major loci affecting
              interindividual variation in recombination rate in Lacaune,
              including the RNF212 and HEI10 genes and possibly two other loci
              of smaller effects including the KCNJ15 and FSHR genes. The
              comparison of these new results to those obtained previously in a
              distantly related population of domestic sheep (the Soay) revealed
              that Soay and Lacaune males have a very similar distribution of
              recombination along the genome. The two data sets were thus
              combined to create more precise male meiotic recombination maps in
              Sheep. However, despite their similar recombination maps, Soay and
              Lacaune males were found to exhibit different heritabilities and
              QTL effects for interindividual variation in genome-wide
              recombination rates. This highlights the robustness of
              recombination patterns to underlying variation in their genetic

              In the germ lines of both sexes, a single accessory chromosome was

               germline-restricted chromosome (GRC), which is only present in
               germline cells and absent from all somatic tissues. Earlier work
               on the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis) showed that
               the GRC is inherited only through the female line-like the
               mitochondria-and is eliminated from the sperm during
               spermatogenesis. Here, we show that the GRC has the potential to
               be paternally inherited. Confocal microscopy using GRC-specific
               fluorescent in situ hybridization probes indicated that a
               considerable fraction of sperm heads (1 to 19\%) in zebra finch
               ejaculates still contained the GRC. In line with these
               cytogenetic data, sequencing of ejaculates revealed that
               individual males from two families differed strongly and
               consistently in the number of GRCs in their ejaculates. Examining
               a captive-bred male hybrid of the two zebra finch subspecies (T.
               g. guttata and T. g. castanotis) revealed that the mitochondria
               originated from a castanotis mother, whereas the GRC came from a
               guttata father. Moreover, analyzing GRC haplotypes across nine
               castanotis matrilines, estimated to have diverged for up to
               250,000 y, showed surprisingly little variability among GRCs.
               This suggests that a single GRC haplotype has spread relatively
               recently across all examined matrilines. A few diagnostic GRC
               mutations that arose since this inferred spreading suggest that
               the GRC has continued to jump across matriline boundaries. Our
               findings raise the possibility that certain GRC haplotypes could
               selfishly spread through the population via occasional paternal
               transmission, thereby outcompeting other GRC haplotypes that were
               limited to strict maternal inheritance, even if this was partly
               detrimental to organismal fitness.",

               Its origin, distribution among avian lineages, and function were
               mostly unknown so far. Using immunolocalization of key meiotic
               proteins, we found that GRCs of varying size and genetic content
               are present in all 16 songbird species investigated and absent
               from germline genomes of all eight examined bird species from
               other avian orders. Results of fluorescent in situ hybridization
               of microdissected GRC probes and their sequencing indicate that
               GRCs show little homology between songbird species and contain a

              chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy; this is largely a
              consequence of nondisjunction during maternal meiosis I.
              Asymmetries of this division render it vulnerable to selfish
              centromeres that promote their own transmission, these being
              thought to somehow underpin aneuploidy. In this essay, I suggest
              that these vulnerabilities provide only half the solution to the
              enigma. In mammals, as in utero and postnatal provisioning is
              continuous, the costs of early death are mitigated. With such
              reproductive compensation, selection can favour a centromere
              because it induces lethal aneuploidy: if, when taken towards the
              polar body, it instead kills the embryo via aneuploidy, it gains.
              The model is consistent with the observation that reduced dosage
              of a murine drive suppressor induces aneuploidy and with the fact
              that high aneuploidy rates in vertebrates are seen exclusively in
              mammals. I propose further tests of this idea. The wastefulness of
              human reproduction may be a price we pay for nurturing our
              offspring.",

               evolutionarily conserved feature of meiosis: within individual
               nuclei, crossover frequencies covary across different
               chromosomes. This effect results from per-nucleus covariation of
               chromosome axis lengths. Crossovers can promote evolutionary
               adaptation. However, the benefit of creating favorable new
               allelic combinations must outweigh the cost of disrupting
               existing favorable combinations. Covariation concomitantly

               concomitantly enhance the benefits of crossing over while

               differences in genome-wide crossover rates, the genetic basis of
               standing variation in SC structure remains unknown. To
               investigate the possibility that recombination evolves through
               changes to the SC, we characterized the genetic architecture of
               SC divergence on two evolutionary timescales. Applying a novel
               digital image analysis technique to spermatocyte spreads, we
               measured total SC length in 9,532 spermatocytes from recombinant
               offspring of wild-derived mouse strains with differences in this
               fundamental meiotic trait. Using this large dataset, we
               identified the first known genomic regions involved in the
               evolution of SC length. Distinct loci affect total SC length
               divergence between and within subspecies, with the X chromosome
               contributing to both. Joint genetic analysis of MLH1
               foci-immunofluorescent markers of crossovers-from the same
               spermatocytes revealed that two of the identified loci also
               confer differences in the genome-wide recombination rate. Causal
               mediation analysis suggested that one pleiotropic locus acts
               early in meiosis to designate crossovers prior to SC assembly,
               whereas a second locus primarily shapes crossover number through
               its effect on SC length. One genomic interval shapes the
               relationship between SC length and recombination rate, likely
               modulating the strength of crossover interference. Our findings

               geographical isolation and spatial heterogeneity in habitat
               characteristics. Our aim is to examine how emigration and
               immigration of house sparrows Passer domesticus in a Norwegian
               archipelagic metapopulation are affected by key factors predicted
               by classic metapopulation models to affect dispersal-spatial and
               temporal variation in population size, inter-island distance,
               local demography and habitat characteristics. This metapopulation
               can be divided into two major habitat types: (a) islands closer
               to the mainland where sparrows breed in colonies on farms, and
               (b) islands without farms, situated farther away from the
               mainland where sparrows are exposed to harsher environmental
               conditions. Dispersal was spatially structured within the
               metapopulation; there was proportionally and numerically less
               emigration and immigration involving farm islands, as compared to
               non-farm islands. Furthermore, emigration and immigration
               occurred mostly between nearby islands. Moreover, emigration in
               response to spatial differences in mean population size differed
               between the habitat types, but populations with large mean
               received more immigrants in both habitat types. The number of
               emigrants and immigrants was negatively related to long-term
               recruit production, which was not the case in non-farm islands.
               The proportion and number of emigrants was positively related to
               temporal increases in recruit production on farm islands, however
               not on non-farm islands. Our results demonstrate that spatial
               heterogeneity in environmental conditions influences how spatial
               variation in long-term mean population size, and temporal and
               spatial variation in recruit production, affects dispersal
               dynamics. The spatial structure of this metapopulation is
               therefore best described by a spatially explicit model in which
               the exchange of individuals within each habitat type is strongly
               affected by the degree of geographical isolation, population size
               and recruit production. However, these relationships differed
               between the two habitat types; non-farm islands showing
               similarities to a mainland-island model type of structure,
               whereas farm islands showed features more associated with
               source-sink or balanced dispersal models. Such differential
               dispersal dynamics between habitat types are expected to have
               important consequences for the ecological and evolutionary

               population genomic data is a challenging problem, in particular
               because of the high background recombination rate. In this paper,
               a new computational method is developed to address this
               challenge. Through an extensive simulation study, it is
               demonstrated that the method allows more accurate inference, and
               exhibits greater robustness to the effects of natural selection
               and noise, compared to a well-used previous method developed for
               studying fine-scale recombination rate variation in the human
               genome. As an application, a genome-wide analysis of genetic
               variation data is performed for two Drosophila melanogaster
               populations, one from North America (Raleigh, USA) and the other
               from Africa (Gikongoro, Rwanda). It is shown that fine-scale
               recombination rate variation is widespread throughout the D.
               melanogaster genome, across all chromosomes and in both
               populations. At the fine-scale, a conservative, systematic search
               for evidence of recombination hotspots suggests the existence of
               a handful of putative hotspots each with at least a tenfold
               increase in intensity over the background rate. A wavelet
               analysis is carried out to compare the estimated recombination
               maps in the two populations and to quantify the extent to which
               recombination rates are conserved. In general, similarity is
               observed at very broad scales, but substantial differences are
               seen at fine scales. The average recombination rate of the X
               chromosome appears to be higher than that of the autosomes in
               both populations, and this pattern is much more pronounced in the
               African population than the North American population. The
               correlation between various genomic features-including
               recombination rates, diversity, divergence, GC content, gene
               content, and sequence quality-is examined using the wavelet
               analysis, and it is shown that the most notable difference
               between D. melanogaster and humans is in the correlation between
               recombination and diversity.",

               (SNP) arrays. Our aim was to create a high density linkage map,
               and to align it with the reference genome assembly. Over 96,000
               SNPs were mapped and ordered on the 29 salmon linkage groups
               using a pedigreed population comprising 622 fish from 60 nuclear
               families, all genotyped with the `ssalar01' high density SNP
               array. The number of SNPs per group showed a high positive
               correlation with physical chromosome length (r = 0.95). While the
               order of markers on the genetic and physical maps was generally
               consistent, areas of discrepancy were identified. Approximately
               6.5\% of the previously unmapped reference genome sequence was
               assigned to chromosomes using the linkage map. Male recombination
               rate was lower than females across the vast majority of the
               genome, but with a notable peak in subtelomeric regions. Finally,
               using RNA-Seq data to annotate the reference genome, the mapped
               SNPs were categorized according to their predicted function,
               including annotation of $\sim{}$2500 putative nonsynonymous

               This study demonstrates that ligation of A20 B cells transfected

               larger than 50 bp. They have been shown to affect more bases in
               any given genome than single-nucleotide polymorphisms or small
               insertions and deletions. Additionally, they have great impact on
               human phenotype and diversity and have been linked to numerous
               diseases. Due to their size and association with repeats, they
               are difficult to detect by shotgun sequencing, especially when
               based on short reads. Long read, single-molecule sequencing
               technologies like those offered by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford
               Nanopore Technologies produce reads with a length of several
               thousand base pairs. Despite the higher error rate and sequencing
               cost, long-read sequencing offers many advantages for the
               detection of structural variants. Yet, available software tools
               still do not fully exploit the possibilities. RESULTS: We present
               SVIM, a tool for the sensitive detection and precise
               characterization of structural variants from long-read data. SVIM
               consists of three components for the collection, clustering and
               combination of structural variant signatures from read
               alignments. It discriminates five different variant classes
               including similar types, such as tandem and interspersed
               duplications and novel element insertions. SVIM is unique in its
               capability of extracting both the genomic origin and destination
               of duplications. It compares favorably with existing tools in
               evaluations on simulated data and real datasets from Pacific
               Biosciences and Nanopore sequencing machines. AVAILABILITY AND
               IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and executables of SVIM are

               gene expression levels using microarray probes designed to
               hybridize to only a small proportion of each gene. Here, we used
               recently developed RNA sequencing protocols, which sidestep this
               limitation, to assess intra- and interspecies variation in gene
               regulatory processes in considerably more detail than was
               previously possible. Specifically, we used RNA-seq to study
               transcript levels in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques,
               using liver RNA samples from three males and three females from
               each species. Our approach allowed us to identify a large number

               studies, but little work has been done to study the impact of sex
               on methylation at the genome wide locus-to-locus level or to
               determine methods for accounting for sex in genomic association
               studies. In this study we investigate the genomic sex effect on
               saliva DNA methylation of 197 subjects (54 females) using 20,493
               CpG sites. Three methods, two-sample T-test, principle component
               analysis and independent component analysis, all successfully
               identify sex influences. The results show that sex not only
               influences the methylation of genes in the X chromosome but also
               in autosomes. 580 autosomal sites show strong differences between
               males and females. They are found to be highly involved in eight
               functional groups, including DNA transcription, RNA splicing,
               membrane, etc. Equally important is that we identify some
               methylation sites associated with not only sex, but also other
               phenotypes (age, smoking and drinking level, and cancer).
               Verification was done through an independent blood cell DNA
               methylation data (1298 CpG sites from a cancer panel array). The
               same genomic site-specific influence pattern and potential
               confounding effects with cancer were observed. The overlapping
               rate of identified sex affected genes between saliva and blood
               cell is 81\% for X chromosome, and 8\% for autosomes. Therefore,
               correction for sex is necessary. We propose a simple correction
               method based on independent component analysis, which is a data
               driven method and accommodates sample differences. Comparison
               before and after the correction suggests that the method is able
               to effectively remove the potentially confounding effects of sex,
               and leave other phenotypes untouched. As such, our method is able
               to disentangle the sex influence on a genome wide level, and
               paves the way to achieve more accurate association analyses in
               genome wide methylation studies.",

               selection are the phenotypes of other individuals. The social
               environment can thus evolve, potentially changing the adaptive
               value for different social strategies. Different branches of
               evolutionary biology have traditionally focused on different
               aspects of these feedbacks. Here, we synthesize behavioral
               ecology theory concerning evolutionarily stable strategies when
               fitness is frequency dependent with quantitative genetic models
               providing statistical descriptions of evolutionary responses to
               social selection. Using path analyses, we review how social
               interactions influence the strength of selection and how social
               responsiveness, social impact, and non-random social assortment
               affect responses to social selection. We then detail how the
               frequency-dependent nature of social interactions fits into this
               framework and how it imposes selection on traits mediating social
               responsiveness, social impact, and social assortment, further

              Current methods of automated TE annotation are also subject to

              Although acute stress generally has positive effects, chronic
              stress typically provokes immunosuppression. The elucidation of
              the mechanisms involved in immunosuppression are of interest for
              the design of therapeutic approaches to avoid the appearance of
              stress disorders. This study aimed to investigate chronic
              stress-induced alterations on lymphocyte subset distribution and
              percentages. The experiments were performed with C57BL/6 mice
              subjected to chronic immobilization stress. RESULTS: Stress caused
              a marked increase in apoptosis inside the thymus, and a reduction
              in the total number of thymocytes. Furthermore, the proportion of
              immature thymocytes declined significantly suggesting that the
              increased apoptosis mainly affected cells of immature phenotype.
              In blood, the total number of lymphocytes diminished but not all
              lymphocyte populations showed the same tendency: while the
              relative proportion of B cells declined slightly, the relative
              proportion of circulating CD3+ cells, and particularly some T cell
              subsets showing an immature phenotype (CD3+PNA+), increased under
              stress. The spleen and lymph nodes show a marked reduction in
              cellularity, but the relative proportion of T cells increased,
              while no change or only a slight reduction was observed in the
              relative proportion of B cells. Similarly, the relative proportion
              of T cells increased in bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed data on
              the alterations of lymphoid cell subsets occurring under
              immobilization stress, both in the bloodstream and in different
              lymphoid tissues, are obtained. In general, T cells are more
              affected than B cells and, in particular, a marked increase in the
              percentage of a subset of circulating PNA+CD3+ T cells is
              observed.",

               reproduction. This indicates that immune system activation can be
               an important agent in life history trade-offs. In this review, we
               evaluate the importance of four currencies generally considered
               as potential mediators of the costs of immune responses in
               ecological studies: (1) energetic costs, (2) nutrient costs, (3)
               autoimmunity and (4) oxidative stress, which may be responsible
               for these trade-offs. A meta-analysis revealed significant
               elevation of energy consumption during an immune response;
               however, the magnitude of this energetic cost was only 5--15\%.
               In a direct comparison using similar immune system activation in
               tits, energetic savings in terms of lowered feeding rate was
               seven times higher than energetic costs of mounting an immune
               response. These results do not support the hypothesis that energy
               is the key proximate currency mediating the costs of immunity.
               Nutrient savings from immunosuppression seem to be even less
               beneficial as this constitutes only a minor part of the daily
               nutrient turnover in the body. In our view, there are some
               indications that oxidative stress can be an important currency
               that could mediate both short-term and long-term costs of immune
               system activation, although direct evidence is so far limited.
               The importance of autoimmune responses is at this point hard to

               ecologists that providing immunological defences to minimise such
               risks to the host is costly in terms of necessitating trade-offs
               with other nutrient-demanding processes such as growth,

               the effects on cellular or humoral immunity, although there were
               few data on cellular immunity, and hence this deserves more
               study. However, in the lines selected for immune function the
               effect on growth was heterogeneous and overall it was close to
               zero. 3. Testing for publication bias revealed that the effect of
               selection for body mass on immune function was robust. However,
               there was considerable heterogeneity in both body mass and immune
               function data. The heterogeneity in the growth-selected lines
               cannot be accounted for by gender or species: the only turkey
               line had an effect size between that of the two chicken lines. 4.
               In conclusion, we found that selection for growth does indeed
               compromise immune function, but selection for immune function did
               not consistently affect growth. This is in agreement with the
               supposition that the costs of growth are large relative to the
               costs of immune function, and on a practical level this suggests
               that it may be possible to breed animals for increased growth
               without loss of immune function.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The evolution of disease resistance and immune
              function may be limited if increased immunocompetence comes at the
              expense of other fitness-determining traits. Both the maintenance
              of an immune system and the deployment of an immune response can
              be costly, and the observed costs may be evaluated as either
              physiological or evolutionary in origin. Evolutionary costs of
              immunological maintenance are revealed as negative genetic
              correlations between immunocompetence and fitness in the absence
              of infection. Costs of deployment are most often studied as
              physiological costs associated with immune system induction,
              however, evolutionary costs of deployment may also be present if
              genotypes vary in the extent of the physiological cost
              experienced. RESULTS: In this study we analyzed evolutionary and
              physiological costs of immunity in two environments representing
              food-limited and food-unlimited conditions. Patterns of genetic
              variation were estimated in females from 40 'hemiclone families'
              isolated from a population of D. melanogaster. Phenotypes
              evaluated included fecundity, weight measures at different time
              periods and resistance to Providencia rettgeri, a naturally
              occurring Gram-negative pathogen of D. melanogaster. In the
              food-limited environment we found a negative genetic correlation
              between fecundity in the absence of infection and resistance,
              indicative of an evolutionary cost of maintenance. No such
              correlation was observed in the food-unlimited environment, and
              the slopes of these correlations significantly differed,
              demonstrating a genotype-by-environment interaction for the cost
              of maintenance. Physiological costs of deployment were also
              observed, but costs were primarily due to wounding. Deployment
              costs were slightly exaggerated in the food-limited environment.
              Evolutionary costs of immunological deployment on fecundity were
              not observed, and there was only marginally significant genetic
              variation in the cost expressed by changes in dry weight.
              CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the costs of immunity may be
              an important factor limiting the evolution of resistance in
              food-limited environments. However, the significant
              genotype-by-environment interaction for maintenance costs,
              combined with the observation that deployment costs were partially
              mitigated in the food-unlimited environment, emphasizes the
              importance of considering environmental variation when estimating
              patterns of genetic variance and covariance, and the dubious
              nature of predicting evolutionary responses to selection from
              quantitative genetic estimates carried out in a single
              environment.",

               trade-offs involving host immune function and parasite defence,
               with the suggestion that they could play a pivotal role in
               mediating well-documented life-history trade-offs, such as the
               cost of reproduction. 2. Among studies of birds, the hypothesized
               link between reproductive effort and parasite defence has
               received particular attention, yet support for a trade-off
               between these two traits remains equivocal. 3. We used
               meta-regression analysis and an information-theoretic approach to
               investigate, among avian studies, how strong the effect of
               experimentally altered reproductive effort is on (i) infection
               with blood parasites from four common genera ( Haemoproteus ,
               Leucocytozoon , Trypanosoma and Plasmodium ) and (ii) the ability
               of hosts to mount an immune response to novel antigenic
               challenge. 4. Across studies, there was a relatively weak but
               well-supported positive effect of reproductive effort on blood
               parasite infection levels. Importantly, this effect was
               significantly influenced by the parasitological measure employed;
               where parasitaemia (proportion of parasitized cells within
               infected hosts) was used as the response variable, effect size
               was almost three times as large as where infection prevalence
               (presence vs. absence of infection among hosts) was measured. 5.
               A moderate negative effect of reproductive effort on immune
               responsiveness was also found across studies. This effect was
               greater the longer the time that had elapsed between manipulation
               of reproductive effort and measurement of immune responsiveness,
               and was also related to the stage at which reproductive effort
               was manipulated, with manipulation during brood rearing producing
               stronger effects than manipulation during incubation. 6. Overall,
               these results provide evidence that reproductive effort can have
               pronounced effects on both parasitism and immune responses, but
               that effect size is influenced by methodology - what is measured
               and when. Exactly how such effects arise and whether they are
               sufficient to provide a mechanistic explanation for the cost of
               reproduction remains to be fully explored.",

              infectious challenges and subtle influences due to the level of
              nutrients or the types of ingredients may at times be of critical
              importance. This review considers seven mechanisms for nutritional
              modulation of resistance to infectious disease in poultry. 1)
              Nutrition may impact the development of the immune system, both in
              ovo and in the first weeks posthatch. Micronutrient deficiencies
              that affect developmental events, such as the seeding of lymphoid
              organs and clonal expansion of lymphocyte clones, can negatively
              impact the immune system later in life. 2) A substrate role of
              nutrients is necessary for the immune response so that responding
              cells can divide and synthesize effector molecules. The
              quantitative need for nutrients for supporting a normal immune
              system, as well as the proliferation of leukocytes and the
              production of antibodies during an infectious challenge, is very
              small relative to uses for growth or egg production. It is likely
              that the systemic acute phase response that accompanies most
              infectious challenges is a more significant consumer of nutrients
              than the immune system itself. 3) The low concentration of some
              nutrients (e.g., iron) in body fluids makes them the limiting
              substrates for the proliferation of invading pathogens and the
              supply of these nutrients is further limited during the immune
              response. 4) Some nutrients (e.g., fatty acids and vitamins A, D,
              and E) have direct regulatory actions on leukocytes by binding to
              intracellular receptors or by modifying the release of second
              messengers. 5) The diet may also have indirect regulatory effects
              that are mediated by the classical endocrine system. 6) Physical
              and chemical aspects of the diet can modify the populations of
              microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, the capacity of
              pathogens to attach to enterocytes, and the integrity of the
              intestinal epithelium.",

              Bird genomes lack the protein PR domain-containing protein 9, a
              key determinant of recombination dynamics in most metazoans.
              Historical recombination maps in birds show an apparent stasis in
              positioning recombination events. This highly conserved
              recombination pattern over long timescales may constrain the
              evolution of recombination in birds. At the same time, extensive
              variation in recombination rate is observed across the genome and
              between different species of birds. Here, we characterize the
              fine-scale historical recombination map of an iconic migratory
              songbird, the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), using a
              linkage disequilibrium-based approach that accounts for population
              demography. Our results reveal variable recombination rates among
              and within chromosomes, which associate positively with nucleotide
              diversity and GC content and negatively with chromosome size.
              Recombination rates increased significantly at regulatory regions
              but not necessarily at gene bodies. CpG islands are associated
              strongly with recombination rates, though their specific position
              and local DNA methylation patterns likely influence this
              relationship. The association with retrotransposons varied
              according to specific family and location. Our results also

              recombination maps between the blackcap and its closest sister

               genome-wide recombination map that is accurate even with small

               chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq)
               revealed strong co-enrichment in the distal, crossover-active

               to estimate genetic variation. In all methods, genetic variation

               paternal links; (ii) Pedigree 2, using SNP-derived assignment of
               both maternity and paternity; and (iii) whole-genome relatedness
               at 37 037 autosomal SNPs. In initial analyses, heritability
               estimates were strikingly similar for all three methods, while
               standard errors were systematically lower in analyses based on
               Pedigree 2 and genomic relatedness. Genetic correlations were

               forensics, plant and animal breeding, conservation and

               calculated from pedigrees, but are now increasingly estimated
               from genetic marker data. Conceptually, a pedigree gives the
               expected F and r values, FP and rP, with the expectations being
               taken (hypothetically) over an infinite number of individuals
               with the same pedigree. In contrast, markers give the realised
               (actual) F and r values at the particular marker loci of the
               particular individuals, FM and rM. Both pedigree (FP, rP) and
               marker (FM, rM) estimates can be used as inferences of genomic
               inbreeding coefficients FG and genomic relatedness rG, which are
               the underlying quantities relevant to most applications (such as
               estimating inbreeding depression and heritability) of F and r. In
               the pre-genomic era, it was widely accepted that pedigrees are
               much better than markers in delineating FG and rG, and markers
               should better be used to validate, amend and construct pedigrees
               rather than to replace them. Is this still true in the genomic
               era when genome-wide dense SNPs are available? In this simulation
               study, I showed that genomic markers can yield much better
               estimates of FG and rG than pedigrees when they are numerous
               (say, 10(4) SNPs) under realistic situations (e.g. genome and
               population sizes). Pedigree estimates are especially poor for
               species with a small genome, where FG and rG are determined to a
               large extent by Mendelian segregations and may thus deviate
               substantially from their expectations (FP and rP). Simulations
               also confirmed that FM, when estimated from many SNPs, can be
               much more powerful than FP for detecting inbreeding depression in
               viability. However, I argue that pedigrees cannot be replaced
               completely by genomic SNPs, because the former allows for the
               calculation of more complicated IBD coefficients (involving more
               than 2 individuals, more than one locus, and more than 2 genes at
               a locus) for which the latter may have reduced capacity or
               limited power, and because the former has social and other
               significance for remote relationships which have little genetic
               significance and cannot be inferred reliably from markers.",

               pathogenic autoantibodies. Genetic predisposition to systemic
               lupus erythematosus results in B cell hyperactivity, survival of
               self-reactive B cells, and differentiation to
               autoantibody-secreting plasma cells (PCs). These corrupt B cell
               responses are, in part, controlled by excess levels of the
               cytokine BAFF that normally maintains B cell homeostasis and
               self-tolerance through limited production. B cell maturation Ag

               lymphoproliferation, accelerated autoantibody production, and

               to control B cell homeostasis and self-tolerance in systemic

               principal effector cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
               arthritis (RA). This study was undertaken to examine the variety
               of stimulating effects of APRIL and its specific effect on FLS in
               the affected RA synovium. METHODS: Synovium and serum samples
               were obtained from patients with RA, patients with osteoarthritis
               (OA), and healthy subjects. Soluble APRIL proteins were assayed
               by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relative gene
               expression of APRIL, BCMA, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis
               factor alpha (TNFalpha), IL-1beta, and RANKL was assessed in RA
               and OA FLS by polymerase chain reaction. Effects of APRIL on the
               production of proinflammatory cytokines and RANKL in RA FLS were
               investigated by flow cytometry and with the use of a BCMA-Fc
               fusion protein. RESULTS: A significantly higher level of soluble
               APRIL was detected in RA serum compared with normal serum. Among
               the 3 receptors of APRIL tested, RA FLS expressed only BCMA,
               whereas OA FLS expressed none of the receptors. APRIL stimulated
               RA FLS, but not OA FLS, to produce IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and
               APRIL itself. In addition, APRIL increased RA FLS expression of
               RANKL and also enhanced progression of the cell cycle of RA FLS.
               Neutralization of APRIL by the BCMA-Fc fusion protein attenuated
               all of these stimulating effects of APRIL on RA FLS. CONCLUSION:
               RA FLS are stimulated by APRIL and express the APRIL receptor
               BCMA. These results provide evidence that APRIL is one of the
               main regulators in the pathogenesis of RA.",

               Patch-derived dendritic cells (PP-DC) exhibit a specialized
               phenotype allowing the promotion of IgA production by B2 cells.
               This phenotype included increased expression of the retinaldehyde
               dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
               B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis family (BAFF), a

               neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The ability of
               PP-DC to promote anti-CD40 dependent IgA was partially dependent

               imparted by the presence of intestinal commensal bacteria, and

               -dependent (TD) IgA class switch factors in the human intestinal

               for human use. One way to facilitate such vaccine development
               could be to identify a practical and relatively low cost
               biomarker assay to assess oral vaccine induced primary and memory
               IgA immune responses in humans. Such an IgA biomarker assay could
               complement antigen-specific immune response measurements,

               reducing the work and costs associated with early oral vaccine
               development. With this in mind, we take a holistic systems
               biology approach to compare the transcriptional signatures of
               peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from volunteers, who
               following two oral priming doses with the oral cholera vaccine

               identify TNFRSF17, a gene encoding the B cell maturation antigen
               (BCMA), as a candidate biomarker of oral vaccine induced IgA
               immune responses. We then assess the ability of BCMA to reflect
               oral vaccine induced primary and memory IgA responses using an
               ELISA BCMA assay on a larger number of samples collected in
               clinical trials with Dukoral\textregistered{} and the oral
               enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli vaccine candidate ETVAX. We find
               significant correlations between levels of BCMA and vaccine
               antigen-specific IgA in antibodies in lymphocyte secretion (ALS)
               specimens, as well as with proportions of circulating
               plasmablasts detected by flow cytometry. Importantly, our results
               suggest that levels of BCMA detected early after primary mucosal
               vaccination may be a biomarker for induction of long-lived
               vaccine specific memory B cell responses, which are otherwise
               difficult to measure in clinical vaccine trials. In addition, we

               plus the adjuvant double mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT) are
               significantly higher than in subjects given ETVAX only. We

               BCMA ELISA assay could also be used to estimate the total

              variants that can be tested for association with complex
              quantitative traits, or used in genomic predictions, is increasing
              exponentially as whole genome sequencing becomes more common. The
              power to identify variants associated with traits, particularly
              those of small effects, could be increased if certain regions of
              the genome were known a priori to be enriched for associations.
              Here, we investigate whether twelve genomic annotation classes
              were enriched or depleted for significant associations in genome
              wide association studies for complex traits in beef and dairy
              cattle. We also describe a variance component approach to
              determine the proportion of genetic variance captured by each
              annotation class. RESULTS: P-values from large GWAS using 700K SNP
              in both dairy and beef cattle were available for 11 and 10 traits
              respectively. We found significant enrichment for trait associated
              variants (SNP significant in the GWAS) in the missense class along
              with regions 5 kilobases upstream and downstream of coding genes.
              We found that the non-coding conserved regions (across mammals)
              were not enriched for trait associated variants. The results from
              the enrichment or depletion analysis were not in complete
              agreement with the results from variance component analysis, where
              the missense and synonymous classes gave the greatest increase in
              variance explained, while the upstream and downstream classes
              showed a more modest increase in the variance explained.
              CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that functional annotations could
              assist in prioritization of variants to a subset more likely to be
              associated with complex traits; including missense variants, and
              upstream and downstream regions. The differences in two sets of
              results (GWAS enrichment depletion versus variance component
              approaches) might be explained by the fact that the variance
              component approach has greater power to capture the cumulative
              effect of mutations of small effect, while the enrichment or
              depletion approach only captures the variants that are significant
              in GWAS, which is restricted to a limited number of common
              variants of moderate effects.",

               segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Cohesins are composed of
               two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC1-SMC3) proteins
               that form a V-shaped heterodimer structure, which is bridged by a
               $\alpha$-kleisin protein and a stromal antigen (STAG) protein.
               Previous studies in mouse have shown that there is one SMC1
               protein (SMC1$\beta$), two $\alpha$-kleisins (RAD21L and REC8)
               and one STAG protein (STAG3) that are meiosis-specific. During
               meiosis, homologous chromosomes must recombine with one another
               in the context of a tripartite structure known as the
               synaptonemal complex (SC). From interaction studies, it has been
               shown that there are at least four meiosis-specific forms of
               cohesin, which together with the mitotic cohesin complex, are
               lateral components of the SC. STAG3 is the only meiosis-specific
               subunit that is represented within all four meiosis-specific
               cohesin complexes. In Stag3 mutant germ cells, the protein level
               of other meiosis-specific cohesin subunits (SMC1$\beta$, RAD21L
               and REC8) is reduced, and their localization to chromosome axes
               is disrupted. In contrast, the mitotic cohesin complex remains
               intact and localizes robustly to the meiotic chromosome axes. The
               instability of meiosis-specific cohesins observed in Stag3
               mutants results in aberrant DNA repair processes, and disruption
               of synapsis between homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, mutation
               of Stag3 results in perturbation of pericentromeric
               heterochromatin clustering, and disruption of centromere cohesion
               between sister chromatids during meiotic prophase. These defects
               result in early prophase I arrest and apoptosis in both male and
               female germ cells. The meiotic defects observed in Stag3 mutants
               are more severe when compared to single mutants for Smc1$\beta$,
               Rec8 and Rad21l, however they are not as severe as the Rec8,
               Rad21l double mutants. Taken together, our study demonstrates
               that STAG3 is required for the stability of all meiosis-specific
               cohesin complexes. Furthermore, our data suggests that STAG3 is
               required for structural changes of chromosomes that mediate
               chromosome pairing and synapsis, DNA repair and progression of

               here that such cleavage plays no detectable role for chromosomal
               events of prophase. (ii) We have analyzed in detail three rec8
               phospho-mutants, with 6, 24 or 29 alanine substitutions. A
               distinct 'separation of function' phenotype is revealed. In the
               mutants, axis formation and recombination initiation are normal,
               as is non-crossover recombination; in contrast, crossover
               (CO)-related events are defective. Moreover, the severities of

               substitution mutations, consistent with the possibility that
               global phosphorylation of Rec8 is important for these effects.

               CO-specific events in conjunction with the maintenance of homolog

               the mouse to find out when interference is imposed and whether
               interference manifests itself at a constant level during meiosis.
               We observed strong interference among MLH1 foci, which mark CO
               positions in pachytene. Additionally, we detected substantial
               interference well before this point, in late zygotene, among MSH4

               foci and RPA foci both mark interhomolog recombinational
               interactions, most of which do not yield COs in the mouse.

               relationship between r(MF) and SD based on the expectation that
               increases in SD should be facilitated by sex-specific genetic
               variance. We show that r(MF) is usually large and positive but
               that it is typically smaller for fitness components. This
               demonstrates that the evolution of SD is typically genetically

               often be opposite in sign due to sub-optimal levels of SD. Most

               important contributor to the evolution of SD by validating the

               pathogens. This repeated structure makes these loci susceptible
               to a high frequency of insertion and deletion events through
               evolutionary time, and also makes them difficult to characterize
               at the genomic level or assay with high-throughput techniques.
               Given the central role of antibodies in the adaptive immune
               system, it is not surprising that early candidate gene approaches
               showed that germline polymorphisms in these regions correlated
               with susceptibility to both infectious and autoimmune diseases.
               However, more recent studies, particularly those using

               restricted to occur through sex-specific expression and splicing

               mechanisms should, however, also be constrained when the sexes
               share the genetic architecture for regulation of gene expression.
               Despite these obstacles, sexual dimorphism is prevalent in the
               animal kingdom and commonly evolves rapidly. Here, we ask whether
               the genetic architecture of gene expression is plastic and easily

               rapidly despite pervasive genetic constraint. To address this

               genetic correlation for gene expression (rMF), which captures how
               independently genes are regulated in the sexes, and the evolution
               of sex-biased gene expression. Using transcriptome data from

               selection have a higher average rMF than other genes. We further

               between D. melanogaster and six other species in the Drosophila

              alveolar lavage (BAL) and lung were harvested at 24 and 72 h with
              markers of infection measured. FER-EP-treated animals reduced

              for Toll-receptor 2 and 4, and increased phagocytic and

               evidence suggesting that host genetics can influence sepsis
               outcomes, no specific loci have yet been convincingly replicated.
               The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that
               influence sepsis survival. METHODS: We did a genome-wide
               association study in three independent cohorts of white adult
               patients admitted to intensive care units with sepsis, severe
               sepsis, or septic shock (as defined by the International
               Consensus Criteria) due to pneumonia or intra-abdominal infection
               (cohorts 1-3, n=2534 patients). The primary outcome was 28 day
               survival. Results for the cohort of patients with sepsis due to
               pneumonia were combined in a meta-analysis of 1553 patients from
               all three cohorts, of whom 359 died within 28 days of admission
               to the intensive-care unit. The most significantly associated
               single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a
               further 538 white patients with sepsis due to pneumonia (cohort
               4), of whom 106 died. FINDINGS: In the genome-wide meta-analysis
               of three independent pneumonia cohorts (cohorts 1-3), common
               variants in the FER gene were strongly associated with survival
               (p=9$\cdot{}$7 \texttimes{} 10(-8)). Further genotyping of the
               top associated SNP (rs4957796) in the additional cohort (cohort
               4) resulted in a combined p value of 5$\cdot{}$6 \texttimes{}
               10(-8) (odds ratio 0$\cdot{}$56, 95\% CI
               0$\cdot{}$45-0$\cdot{}$69). In a time-to-event analysis, each
               allele reduced the mortality over 28 days by 44\% (hazard ratio
               for death 0$\cdot{}$56, 95\% CI 0$\cdot{}$45-0$\cdot{}$69;
               likelihood ratio test p=3$\cdot{}$4 \texttimes{} 10(-9), after
               adjustment for age and stratification by cohort). Mortality was
               9$\cdot{}$5\% in patients carrying the CC genotype,
               15$\cdot{}$2\% in those carrying the TC genotype, and
               25$\cdot{}$3\% in those carrying the TT genotype. No significant
               genetic associations were identified when patients with sepsis
               due to pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection were combined.
               INTERPRETATION: We have identified common variants in the FER
               gene that associate with a reduced risk of death from sepsis due
               to pneumonia. The FER gene and associated molecular pathways are
               potential novel targets for therapy or prevention and candidates
               for the development of biomarkers for risk stratification.

               biochemical fractionation and quantitative mass spectrometry, we
               identified a cGAMP synthase (cGAS), which belongs to the
               nucleotidyltransferase family. Overexpression of cGAS activated
               the transcription factor IRF3 and induced interferon-$\beta$ in a
               STING-dependent manner. Knockdown of cGAS inhibited IRF3
               activation and interferon-$\beta$ induction by DNA transfection

               catalyzed cGAMP synthesis. These results indicate that cGAS is a
               cytosolic DNA sensor that induces interferons by producing the
               second messenger cGAMP.",

               to cause immunopathology in some acute viral infections, such as

               infection of macrophages, activation of cytosolic surveillance
               pathways is dependent on the mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system
               and leads to type I interferon (IFN) and interleukin-1$\beta$

               to control cancer by restoring or activating the immune system.
               Nevertheless, multiple mechanisms are involved in immunotherapy
               resistance which limits the clinical benefit of checkpoint
               inhibitors. An immunosuppressive microenvironment is an important
               factor mediating the original resistance of tumors to
               immunotherapy. A previous report by our group has demonstrated
               that local angiotensin II (AngII) predominantly exists in a tumor
               hypoxic microenvironment where hypoxic tumour cells produced
               AngII by a hypoxia-lactate-chymase-dependent mechanism. RESULTS:
               Here, using 4T1 and CT26 syngeneic mouse tumor models, we found
               that local AngII in the tumor microenvironment was involved in
               immune escape of tumour cells and an AngII signaling blockage
               sensitized tumours to checkpoint immunotherapy. Furthermore, an
               AngII signaling blockage reversed the tumor immunosuppressive
               microenvironment, and inhibition of angiotensinogen (AGT, a
               precursor of AngII) expression strongly triggered an
               immune-activating cytokine profile in hypoxic mouse cancer cells.
               More importantly, AGT silencing combined with a checkpoint
               blockage generated an abscopal effect in resistant tumors.
               CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated an important role of local
               AngII in the formation of a tumor immunosuppressive
               microenvironment and its blockage may enhance tumor sensitivity
               to checkpoint immunotherapy. The combination of an AngII
               signaling blocker and an immune-checkpoint blockage could be a
               promising strategy to improve tumors responses to current

               considered eligible all retrieved association studies that
               claimed different genetic effects across sexes of 1 or more gene
               variants for any human disease or phenotype. We considered both
               biallelic and multiallelic markers (including haplotypes) and

               documented claims we performed the calculations for gene-sex
               interaction whenever raw data were available. Finally, we
               compared the sex-difference claims with the best internal
               validity against the results of other studies addressing the same
               interaction. RESULTS: We appraised 432 sex-difference claims in
               77 eligible articles. Authors stated that sex comparisons were
               decided a priori for 286 claims (66.2\%), while the entire sample
               size was used in 210 (48.6\%) claims. Appropriate documentation
               of gene-sex interaction was recorded in 55 claims (12.7\%);
               documentation was insufficient for 303 claims and spurious for
               the other 74. Data for reanalysis of claims were available for
               188 comparisons. Of these, 83 (44.1\%) were nominally
               statistically significant at a P = .05 threshold, and more than
               half of them (n = 44) had modest P values between .01 and .05. Of
               60 claims with seemingly the best internal validity, only 1 was
               consistently replicated in at least 2 other studies. CONCLUSION:
               In this sample of highly prominent claims of sex-related
               differences in genetic associations, most claims were
               insufficiently documented or spurious, and claims with documented
               good internal and external validity were uncommon.",

               tests of interaction in subgroup analyses in clinical trials,
               inappropriate subgroup-specific analyses continue. Moreover,
               trials designed to detect overall treatment effects have limited
               power to detect treatment-subgroup interactions. This article
               quantifies the error rates associated with subgroup analyses.
               STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Simulations quantified the risks of
               misinterpreting subgroup analyses as evidence of differential
               subgroup effects and the limited power of the interaction test in
               trials designed to detect overall treatment effects. RESULTS:
               Although formal interaction tests performed as expected with
               respect to false positives, subgroup-specific tests were
               considerably less reliable: A significant effect in one subgroup
               only was observed in 7\% to 64\% of simulations depending on
               trial characteristics. Regarding power of the interaction test, a
               trial with 80\% power for the overall effect had only 29\% power
               to detect an interaction effect of the same magnitude. For
               interactions of this size to be detected with the same power as
               the overall effect, sample sizes should be inflated fourfold,
               increasing dramatically for interactions smaller than 20\% of the
               overall effect. CONCLUSION: Although it is generally recognized
               that subgroup analyses can produce spurious results, the extent
               of the problem may be underestimated.",

              million individuals worldwide, with higher prevalence in females,
              and a strong genetic component. While over 200 MS susceptibility
              loci have been identified in GWAS, the underlying mechanisms
              whereby they contribute to disease susceptibility remains
              ill-defined. Forward genetics approaches using conventional
              laboratory mouse strains are useful in identifying and

              phenotypes, but are hindered by the limited genetic diversity

              powerful chromosome substitution (consomic) strain approach with
              the genetic diversity of a wild-derived inbred mouse strain. Using
              experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of
              MS, we evaluated genetic control of disease course among a panel
              of 26 consomic strains of mice inheriting chromosomes from the
              wild-derived PWD strain on the C57BL/6J background, which models
              the genetic diversity seen in human populations. Nineteen linkages
              on 18 chromosomes were found to harbor loci controlling EAE. Of
              these 19 linkages, six were male-specific, four were
              female-specific, and nine were non-sex-specific, consistent with a
              differential genetic control of disease course between males and
              females. An MS-GWAS candidate-driven bioinformatic analysis using
              orthologous genes linked to EAE course identified sex-specific and
              non-sex-specific gene networks underlying disease pathogenesis. An
              analysis of sex hormone regulation of genes within these networks
              identified several key molecules, prominently including the MAP
              kinase family, known hormone-dependent regulators of sex
              differences in EAE course. Importantly, our results provide the
              framework by which consomic mouse strains with overall genome-wide
              genetic diversity, approximating that seen in humans, can be used
              as a rapid and powerful tool for modeling the genetic architecture

               Senescence and limited lifespan are thought to arise because weak
               natural selection late in life allows the accumulation of
               mutations with deleterious late-age effects that are either
               neutral (the mutation accumulation hypothesis) or beneficial (the
               antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis) early in life. Analyses of
               Drosophila spontaneous mutations, patterns of segregating
               variation and covariation, and lines selected for late-age
               fertility have implicated both classes of mutation in the

               and mapped to the same regions as candidate genes with fertility,
               cellular aging, stress resistance and male-specific effects. Late

               males during the first year of life between horn length, body
               weight, and parasite load in environments of different quality.

               sex, which may arise from a history of sex-specific selection-in

               exaggeration is expected to be greater in higher condition
               individuals (condition-dependent). Although studies using small
               numbers of morphological traits are generally supportive, this
               prediction has not been examined at a larger scale. We test this
               prediction across the transcriptome by determining the
               condition-dependence of sex-biased (dimorphic) gene expression.
               We find that high-condition populations are more sexually
               dimorphic in transcription than low-condition populations.
               High-condition populations have more male-biased genes and more
               female-biased genes, and a greater degree of sexually dimorphic
               expression in these genes. Also, condition-dependence in
               male-biased genes was greater than in a set of unbiased genes.
               Interestingly, male-biased genes expressed in the testes were not
               more condition-dependent than those in the soma. By contrast,
               increased female-biased expression under high condition may have
               occurred because of the greater contribution of the
               ovary-specific transcripts to the entire mRNA pool. We did not
               find any genomic signatures distinguishing the
               condition-dependent sex-biased genes. The degree of
               condition-dependent sexual dimorphism (CDSD) did not differ
               between the autosomes and the X chromosome. There was only weak
               evidence that rates of evolution correlated with CDSD. We suggest
               that the sensitivity of both female-biased genes and male-biased
               genes to condition may be akin to the overall heightened
               sensitivity to condition that life-history and sexually selected
               traits tend to exhibit. Our results demonstrate that through
               condition-dependence, early life experience has dramatic effects
               on sexual dimorphism in the adult transcriptome.",

              and other vertebrates. Sex hormones act as important modulators of
              immune responses; the male sex hormone testosterone is generally
              immunosuppressive while the female sex hormone estrogen tends to
              be immunoenhancing. Different sets of T-helper cells (Th) have
              important roles in adaptive immunity, e.g. Th1 cells trigger type
              1 responses which are primarily cell-mediated, and Th2 cells
              trigger type 2 responses which are primarily humoral responses. In
              our review of the literature, we find that estrogen and
              progesterone enhance type 2 and suppress type 1 responses in
              females, whereas testosterone suppresses type 2 responses and
              shows an inconsistent pattern for type 1 responses in males. When
              we combine these patterns of generally immunosuppressive and
              immunoenhancing effects of the sex hormones, our results imply
              that the sex differences in immune responses should be
              particularly strong in immune functions associated with type 2
              responses, and less pronounced with type 1 responses. In general
              the hormone-mediated sex differences in immune responses may lead
              to genetic sexual conflicts on immunity. Thus, we propose the
              novel hypothesis that sexually antagonistic selection may act on
              immune genes shared by the sexes, and that the strength of this
              sexually antagonistic selection should be stronger for type 2- as
              compared with type 1-associated immune genes. Finally, we put the
              consequences of sex hormone-induced effects on immune responses

               handicaps in order to evolve. To a large extent, handicap
               hypotheses have relied on energetic explanations for these costs.
               Here, we have presented a phenomenological model, operating on an
               intraspecific level, which views the cost of secondary sexual
               development from an endocrinological perspective. The primary
               androgenic hormone, testosterone, has a dualistic effect; it
               stimulates development of characteristics used in sexual
               selection while reducing immu- nocompetence. This ``double-edged
               sword'' creates a physiological trade-off that influences and is

               versus that of increased reproductive success afforded by
               exaggerated signals. We clarify how this trade-off is intimately

               autonomic mechanisms in 14 matched pairs of men and women (n =
               28). Monocyte intracellular IL-6 production was repeatedly
               assessed over two circadian periods. Sympathetic balance was
               estimated by heart rate variability and the ratio of power in the
               low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF); vagal tone was indexed
               by the power of HF component. As compared to men, women showed
               greater monocyte expression of IL-6 across the circadian period.
               In addition, women showed lower sympathetic balance (LF/HF
               ratio), and greater levels of vagal tone (HF power). In women,

               Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that sex may also influence
               the early perception of microbial challenges and the generation
               of inflammatory immune responses such as sepsis. These

               reproductive hormones. Whereas androgens have been shown to
               suppress acute host immune responses to bacterial endotoxin
               challenge, estrogens have been found to promote increased
               resistance to bacterial infections. However, the mechanisms by
               which estrogens exert immunoprotective effects have not been

               of 17beta-estradiol on endotoxin susceptibility in mice.
               Importantly, we have examined the actions of this female

               (ERalpha)-dependent activation of the PI3K pathway. In the

               peritoneal macrophages to E2 enhanced Akt phosphorylation and
               slightly decreased LPS-induced cytokine production. In striking
               contrast, we show that chronic administration of E2 to

               IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12p40, and inducible NO synthase by resident
               peritoneal macrophages in response to LPS ex vivo. These results

               predict the long-term effect of estrogens in vivo on peritoneal
               macrophage functions. We show that this in vivo proinflammatory
               effect of E2 was mediated through ERalpha. Although the
               expression of components of the LPS-recognition complex remained
               unchanged, we provided evidences for alterations of the TLR4
               signaling pathway in macrophages from E2-treated mice. Indeed, E2
               treatment resulted in the inhibition of PI3K activity and Akt
               phosphorylation in LPS-activated macrophages, whereas NF-kappaB

               Incubation of macrophages with the PI3K inhibitor wortmanin

               TLR4 activation, and abolishes the difference between cells from
               placebo- or E2-treated mice, demonstrating the pivotal role of
               the PI3K/Akt pathway. We conclude that the macrophage activation
               status is enhanced in vivo by E2 through ERalpha and, at least in
               part, by the down-modulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby

               genome-wide mapping and immunocytology, we show that
               transformation of additional HEI10 copies is sufficient to more
               than double euchromatic crossovers. However, heterochromatic
               centromeres remained recombination-suppressed. The strongest
               HEI10-mediated crossover increases occur in subtelomeric
               euchromatin, which is reminiscent of sex differences in
               Arabidopsis recombination. Our work reveals that HEI10 naturally
               limits Arabidopsis crossovers and has the potential to influence
               the response to selection.",

               for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in
               population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data
               from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a
               strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key
               functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium
               estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS
               and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype
               likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants,
               none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data
               format. FINDINGS: To address these issues, we are developing a
               second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release
               from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of
               bit-level parallelism, [Formula: see text]-time/constant-space
               Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many
               other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes
               accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow
               the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have
               also developed an extension to the data format which adds
               low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase,
               multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which
               is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0).

               challenge, and should be guided by evolutionary principles.
               Recent studies in evolutionary genetics show that sexual
               selection can have a profound influence on the genetic
               architecture of complex traits. Here, we summarise data from
               heritability studies and genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
               showing that common genetic variation influences many diseases
               and medically relevant traits in a sex-dependent manner. In
               addition, we discuss how the discovery of sex-dependent effects
               in population samples is improved by joint interaction analysis
               (rather than separate-sex), as well as by recently developed
               software. Finally, we argue that although genetic variation that
               has sex-dependent effects on disease risk could be maintained by
               mutation-selection balance and genetic drift, recent evidence
               indicates that intra-locus sexual conflict could be a powerful
               influence on complex trait architecture, and maintain
               sex-dependent disease risk alleles in a population because they
               are beneficial to the opposite sex.",

               experimental and correlational, have been conducted to test the
               relationship between immune function and the sex hormones
               testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. However, the
               results are mixed. We conducted four cross-species meta-analyses
               to investigate the relationship between sex hormones and immune
               function: (i) the effect of testosterone manipulation on immune
               function in males, (ii) the correlation between circulating
               testosterone level and immune function in males, (iii) the effect
               of oestrogen manipulation on immune function in females, and (iv)
               the correlation between circulating oestrogen level and immune
               function in females. The results from the experimental studies
               showed that testosterone had a medium-sized immunosuppressive
               effect on immune function. The effect of oestrogen, on the other
               hand, depended on the immune measure used. Oestrogen suppressed
               cell-mediated immune function while reducing parasite loads. The
               overall correlation (meta-analytic relationship) between
               circulating sex hormone level and immune function was not
               statistically significant for either testosterone or oestrogen
               despite the power of meta-analysis. These results suggest that
               correlational studies have limited value for testing the effects
               of sex hormones on immune function. We found little evidence of
               publication bias in the four data sets using indirect tests.
               There was a weak and positive relationship between year of
               publication and effect size for experimental studies of
               testosterone that became non-significant after we controlled for
               castration and immune measure, suggesting that the temporal trend
               was due to changes in these moderators over time. Graphical
               analyses suggest that the temporal trend was due to an increased
               use of cytokine measures across time. We found substantial
               heterogeneity in effect sizes, except in correlational studies of
               testosterone, even after we accounted for the relevant random and
               fixed factors. In conclusion, our results provide good evidence

               of the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex
               (MHC) already characterized for familial crossovers.
               High-resolution LD analysis shows the existence of extended
               domains of strong association interrupted by patchwork areas of
               LD breakdown. Sperm typing shows that these areas correspond

               vary considerably in intensity, and are not obviously associated

               These hot spots occur in clusters and together account for almost
               all crossovers in this region of the MHC. These data show that,
               within the MHC at least, crossovers are far from randomly

               based on population data provides finer resolution data albeit
               depending on the effective population size and acting selective
               forces. In this study, we use a combination of these two methods,
               using a dataset of whole genome sequences and elucidate the
               recombination landscape for the Afro-European barn owl (Tyto

               effective shuffling of alleles. LD based estimates of
               recombination are concordant with family-based estimates and
               identify large variation in recombination rates within and among

               recombination rates while smaller chromosomes have a universally

               divergence. Within an inversion differentiating Drosophila

               consistent with published double-crossover frequencies observed
               within species. Despite similar rates of exchange within and
               between species, we found no sequence-based evidence of ongoing
               gene exchange between species within this inversion, but
               significant exchange was inferred within species. We also
               observed greater differentiation at regions near inversion
               breakpoints between species versus within species. Moreover, we
               observed strong ``interchromosomal effect'' (higher recombination

               higher recombination rates along collinear segments of chromosome
               two in hybrids. Further, we observed that regions most
               susceptible to changes in recombination rates corresponded to
               regions with lower recombination rates in homokaryotypes.
               Finally, we showed that interspecies nucleotide divergence is
               lower in regions with greater increases in recombination rate,
               potentially resulting from greater interspecies exchange.

               these differences are most likely due to lower frequency of
               heterokaryotypes and to fitness consequences from the
               accumulation of various incompatibilities between species.
               Additionally, we have identified possible effects of inversions

              animal species to build genome-wide recombination maps. However,
              the reliability of these inferences has only been assessed under a
              restrictive set of conditions. Here, we evaluate the ability of
              one of the most widely used coalescent-based programs,LDhelmet, to
              infer a genomic landscape of recombination with the biological
              characteristics of a human-like landscape including hotspots.
              Using simulations, we specifically assessed the impact of
              methodological (sample size, phasing errors, block penalty) and
              evolutionary parameters (effective population size (Ne),
              demographic history, mutation to recombination rate ratio) on
              inferred map quality. We report reasonably good correlations
              between simulated and inferred landscapes, but point to
              limitations when it comes to detecting recombination hotspots.
              False positive and false negative hotspots considerably confound
              fine-scale patterns of inferred recombination under a wide range
              of conditions, particularly whenNeis small and the
              mutation/recombination rate ratio is low, to the extent that maps
              inferred from populations sharing the same recombination landscape

              users of these approaches, at least for genomes with complex
              recombination landscapes such as in humans.",

               Despite the functional importance of recombination, recombination
               landscapes vary widely among and within species, and this can
               have a strong impact on evolutionary processes. A good knowledge
               of recombination landscapes is important for model systems in
               evolutionary and ecological genetics, since it can improve
               interpretation of genomic patterns of differentiation and genome

               model for studying the molecular basis of adaptation and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genotype imputation can help reduce genotyping costs
              particularly for implementation of genomic selection. In
              applications entailing large populations, recovering the genotypes
              of untyped loci using information from reference individuals that
              were genotyped with a higher density panel is computationally
              challenging. Popular imputation methods are based upon the Hidden
              Markov model and have computational constraints due to an
              intensive sampling process. A fast, deterministic approach, which
              makes use of both family and population information, is presented
              here. All individuals are related and, therefore, share haplotypes
              which may differ in length and frequency based on their
              relationships. The method starts with family imputation if
              pedigree information is available, and then exploits close
              relationships by searching for long haplotype matches in the
              reference group using overlapping sliding windows. The search
              continues as the window size is shrunk in each chromosome sweep in
              order to capture more distant relationships. RESULTS: The proposed
              method gave higher or similar imputation accuracy than Beagle and
              Impute2 in cattle data sets when all available information was
              used. When close relatives of target individuals were present in
              the reference group, the method resulted in higher accuracy
              compared to the other two methods even when the pedigree was not
              used. Rare variants were also imputed with higher accuracy.
              Finally, computing requirements were considerably lower than those
              of Beagle and Impute2. The presented method took 28 minutes to
              impute from 6 k to 50 k genotypes for 2,000 individuals with a
              reference size of 64,429 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed
              method efficiently makes use of information from close and distant
              relatives for accurate genotype imputation. In addition to its
              high imputation accuracy, the method is fast, owing to its
              deterministic nature and, therefore, it can easily be used in
              large data sets where the use of other methods is impractical.",

               The factors predisposing pigs to chromosome rearrangements,

               breakpoints was analyzed across three level, chromosomes,

               factors, such as the length of bands, chromatin density, and

               translocation breakpoints. The characteristics of these bands
               were largely similar to that of hotspots in the human genome.
               Therefore, those hotspots are proposed as a starting point for

               genetic screening by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis revealed

               mostly unclear. Here we report the comparative analysis of PRDM
               genes, a family of putative transcriptional regulators involved
               in human tumorigenesis. Results Our analysis assessed that the
               PRDM genes originated in metazoans, expanded in vertebrates and
               further duplicated in primates. We experimentally showed that
               fast-evolving paralogs are poorly expressed, and that the most
               recent duplicates, such as primate-specific PRDM7, acquire
               tissue-specificity. PRDM7 underwent major structural
               rearrangements that decreased the number of encoded Zn-Fingers
               and modified gene splicing. Through internal duplication and
               activation of a non-canonical splice site (GC-AG), PRDM7 can
               acquire a novel intron. We also detected an alternative isoform
               that can retain the intron in the mature transcript and that is
               predominantly expressed in human melanocytes. Conclusion Our

              the genome responds to selection. Our increasingly detailed
              understanding of its molecular underpinnings raises the prospect
              that we can gain insight into trait divergence by examining the
              molecular evolution of recombination genes from a pathway
              perspective, as in mammals, where protein-coding changes in the
              later stages of the recombination pathway are connected to
              divergence in intra-clade recombination rate. Here, we leveraged
              increasing availability of avian and teleost genomes to
              reconstruct the evolution of the recombination pathway across two
              additional vertebrate clades: birds, which have higher and more
              variable rates of recombination and similar divergence times to
              mammals; and teleost fish, which have much deeper divergence
              times. We found that the rates of molecular evolution of
              recombination genes are highly correlated between vertebrate
              clades, suggesting that they experience similar selective
              pressures. However, recombination genes in birds were
              significantly more likely to exhibit signatures of positive
              selection, unrestricted to later stages of the pathway. There is a
              significant correlation between genes linked to recombination rate
              variation in mammalian populations and those with signatures of
              positive selection across the avian phylogeny, suggesting a link
              between selection and recombination rate. In contrast, the teleost
              fish recombination pathway is more highly conserved with
              significantly less evidence of positive selection. This is
              surprising given the high variability of recombination rates in

               treating evolvability as a property of populations rather than

               Mendelian genetics. Meiosis is a specialised, reductional cell
               division which generates haploid gametes (reproductive cells)
               carrying a single chromosome complement from diploid progenitor
               cells harbouring two chromosome sets. Through this process, the
               hereditary material is shuffled and distributed into haploid
               gametes such that upon fertilisation, when two haploid gametes
               fuse, diploidy is restored in the zygote. During meiosis the
               transient physical connection of two homologous chromosomes (one
               originally inherited from each parent) each consisting of two
               sister chromatids and their subsequent segregation into four
               meiotic products (gametes), is what enables genetic marker
               assortment forming the core of Mendelian laws. The initiating
               events of meiotic recombination are DNA double-strand breaks
               (DSBs) which need to be repaired in a certain way to enable the
               homologous chromosomes to find each other. This is achieved by
               DSB ends searching for homologous repair templates and invading
               them. Ultimately, the repair of meiotic DSBs by homologous
               recombination physically connects homologous chromosomes through
               crossovers. These physical connections provided by crossovers
               enable faithful chromosome segregation. That being said, the DSB
               repair mechanism integral to meiotic recombination also produces
               genetic transmission distortions which manifest as postmeiotic
               segregation events and gene conversions. These processes are

               However, the strength of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) in
               human populations and its effects on hereditary disease have yet
               to be assessed on a genomic scale. Using high-coverage
               whole-genome sequences of African hunter-gatherers, agricultural
               populations, and primate outgroups, we quantified the effects of
               GC-biased gene conversion on population genomic data sets. We
               find that genetic distances (FST and population branch
               statistics) are modified by gBGC. In addition, the site frequency
               spectrum is left-shifted when ancestral alleles are favored by
               gBGC and right-shifted when derived alleles are favored by gBGC.
               Allele frequency shifts due to gBGC mimic the effects of natural
               selection. As expected, these effects are strongest in
               high-recombination regions of the human genome. By comparing the

               Nb $\approx{}$ 0.05 to 0.09. We also find that derived alleles
               favored by gBGC are much more likely to be homozygous than
               derived alleles at unbiased SNPs (+42.2\% to 62.8\%). This
               results in a curse of the converted, whereby gBGC causes

              common origins of both oocytes and spermatogonia. Unlike in other

              the genital ridge, and are one of the major biological properties

              mitotic arrest during embryogenesis and enter meiosis only after
              birth. In chicken, gonadal sex differentiation occurs as early as
              embryonic day 6, but meiotic initiation of female germ cells
              starts from a relatively late stage (embryonic day 15.5). Retinoic

               transcription factor F1 (FOXF1) gene locus are frequently found

               of pulmonary veins, a lethal congenital disorder, which is
               characterized by severe abnormalities in the respiratory,
               cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. In mice,
               haploinsufficiency of the Foxf1 gene causes alveolar capillary
               dysplasia and developmental defects in lung, intestinal, and gall
               bladder morphogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Although FOXF1 is expressed in
               multiple mesenchyme-derived cell types, cellular origins and
               molecular mechanisms of developmental abnormalities in
               FOXF1-deficient mice and patients with alveolar capillary
               dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins remain
               uncharacterized because of lack of mouse models with
               cell-restricted inactivation of the Foxf1 gene. In the present
               study, the role of FOXF1 in endothelial cells was examined using
               a conditional knockout approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: A novel
               mouse line harboring Foxf1-floxed alleles was generated by
               homologous recombination. Tie2-Cre and Pdgfb-CreER transgenes
               were used to delete Foxf1 from endothelial cells. FOXF1-deficient
               embryos exhibited embryonic lethality, growth retardation,
               polyhydramnios, cardiac ventricular hypoplasia, and vascular
               abnormalities in the lung, placenta, yolk sac, and retina.
               Deletion of FOXF1 from endothelial cells reduced endothelial
               proliferation, increased apoptosis, inhibited vascular
               endothelial growth factor signaling, and decreased expression of

              Although there is a loss of antioxidants with aging, the impact on
              aging male germ cells of the complete absence of either catalase
              (CAT) or superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) has not been investigated.
              We used CAT-null (Cat(-/-)) and SOD1-null (Sod(-/-)) mice to
              determine whether loss of these antioxidants increases germ cell
              susceptibility to redox dysfunction with aging. Aging reduced
              fertility and the numbers of Sertoli and germ cells in all mice.
              Aged Sod(-/-) mice displayed an increased loss of fertility
              compared to aged wild-type mice. Treatment with the pro-oxidant
              SIN-10 increased ROS in spermatocytes of aged wild-type and
              Sod(-/-) mice, while aged Cat(-/-) mice were able to neutralize
              this ROS. The antioxidant peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) increased with
              age in wild-type and Cat(-/-) mice but was consistently low in
              young and aged Sod(-/-) mice. DNA damage and repair markers
              ($\gamma$-H2AX and 53BP1) were reduced with aging and lower in
              young Sod(-/-) and Cat(-/-) mice. Colocalization of $\gamma$-H2AX
              and 53BP1 suggested active repair in young wild-type mice but
              reduced in young Cat(-/-) and in Sod(-/-) mice and with age.
              Oxidative DNA damage (8-oxodG) increased in young Sod(-/-) mice
              and with age in all mice. These studies show that aged Sod(-/-)
              mice display severe redox dysfunction, while wild-type and
              Cat(-/-) mice have compensatory mechanisms to partially alleviate
              oxidative stress and reduce age-related DNA damage in spermatozoa.
              Thus, SOD1 but not CAT is critical to the maintenance of germ cell

               (SOD1) plays a pivotal role in antioxidation by scavenging the

               mice, but the significance of the enzyme in male mice remains
               unclear. In the present study, we characterized Sod1(-/-)

               of the impaired fertilizing ability of Sod1-KO sperm in in vitro

               sperm exhibited lower rates of fertility compared with
               insemination by wild-type sperm. The low fertilizing ability
               found for Sod1-KO sperm was partially rescued by reductant
               2-mercaptoethanol, which suggested the oxidative modification of
               sperm components. The numbers of motile and progressive sperm

               capacitation, was also impaired in the Sod1-KO sperm. These

               capacitation and motility are vulnerable to oxidative damage
               during the in vitro fertilization process, which could increase
               the rate of inefficient fertilization.",

               genomic data often omit haplotype information due to constraints

               haplotypes for over 600 individual butterflies (Heliconius erato

              landscapes within and between species has remained a central,
              though challenging, question. Recombination rates are widely
              observed to negatively associate with the abundance of
              transposable elements (TEs), selfish genetic elements that move
              between genomic locations. While such associations are usually
              interpreted as recombination influencing the efficacy of selection
              at removing TEs, accumulating findings suggest that TEs could
              instead be the cause rather than the consequence. To test this
              prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic,
              putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and
              benchmarked a novel approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing
              to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify
              crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers
              of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to

              that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local
              enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such
              an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous
              sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps
              between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is
              further supported by two orthogonal approaches-analyzing the
              distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in
              relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted
              estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without
              transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the

               chromosomes - a condition termed aneuploidy, which is much more
               prevalent in eggs than in either sperm or in most somatic cells.
               In turn, aneuploidy in eggs is a leading cause of infertility,
               miscarriage and congenital syndromes. Aneuploidy arises as a
               consequence of aberrant meiosis during egg development from its
               progenitor cell, the oocyte. In human oocytes, chromosomes often
               segregate incorrectly. Chromosome segregation errors increase in

              Composing a coherent view across species has been difficult
              because of the differences in recombination map generation and
              reporting of the results. Thus, fundamental questions like why
              recombination rates differ between sexes (heterochiasmy) in many

              collection of recombination maps that allows quantitative

               species, which has limited its broader utility in evolutionary
               biology. Indeed, to our knowledge no general-purpose, flexible
               modeling framework exists that provides support for simulating
               multiple species while also providing other key features, such as
               explicit genetics and continuous space. The lack of such software
               has limited our ability to model higher biological levels such as
               communities, ecosystems, coevolutionary and eco-evolutionary
               processes, and biodiversity, which is crucial for many purposes,
               from extending our basic understanding of evolutionary ecology to
               informing conservation and management decisions. We here announce
               the release of SLiM 4, which fills this important gap by adding
               support for multiple species, including ecological interactions
               between species such as predation, parasitism, and mutualism, and
               illustrate its new features with examples.",

               has a very distinct karyotype consisting of many micro- and a few
               macrochromosomes. While it is known that recombination
               frequencies are much higher for micro- as compared to
               macrochromosomes, there is limited information on differences in
               linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype diversity between these
               two classes of chromosomes. In this study, LD and haplotype
               diversity were systematically characterized in 371 birds from
               eight chicken populations (commercial lines, fancy breeds, and
               red jungle fowl) across macro- and microchromosomes. To this end
               we sampled four regions of approximately 1 cM each on
               macrochromosomes (GGA1 and GGA2), and four 1.5 -2 cM regions on
               microchromosomes (GGA26 and GGA27) at a high density of 1 SNP
               every 2 kb (total of 889 SNPs). RESULTS: At a similar physical
               distance, LD, haplotype homozygosity, haploblock structure, and
               haplotype sharing were all lower for the micro- as compared to
               the macrochromosomes. These differences were consistent across
               populations. Heterozygosity, genetic differentiation, and derived
               allele frequencies were also higher for the microchromosomes.
               Differences in LD, haplotype variation, and haplotype sharing
               between populations were largely in line with known demographic
               history of the commercial chicken. Despite very low levels of LD,
               as measured by r2 for most populations, some haploblock structure
               was observed, particularly in the macrochromosomes, but the
               haploblock sizes were typically less than 10 kb. CONCLUSION:
               Differences in LD between micro- and macrochromosomes were almost
               completely explained by differences in recombination rate.
               Differences in haplotype diversity and haplotype sharing between
               micro- and macrochromosomes were explained by differences in
               recombination rate and genotype variation. Haploblock structure
               was consistent with demography of the chicken populations, and
               differences in recombination rates between micro- and
               macrochromosomes. The limited haploblock structure and LD
               suggests that future whole-genome marker assays will need 100+K
               SNPs to exploit haplotype information. Interpretation and
               transferability of genetic parameters will need to take into
               account the size of chromosomes in chicken, and, since most birds
               have microchromosomes, in other avian species as well.",

              Although genetic maps have been developed for numerous plant
              species since the late 1980s, few of these maps have provided the
              necessary resolution needed to investigate the genomic and
              epigenomic features underlying meiotic crossovers. RESULTS: Using
              a whole genome sequencing-based approach, we developed two
              high-density reference-based haplotype maps using diploid potato
              clones as parents. The vast majority (81\%) of meiotic crossovers
              were mapped to less than 5 kb. The fine-scale accuracy of
              crossover detection was validated by Sanger sequencing for a
              subset of ten crossover events. We demonstrate that crossovers
              reside in genomic regions of ``open chromatin'', which were
              identified based on hypersensitivity to DNase I digestion and
              association with H3K4me3-modified nucleosomes. The genomic regions
              spanning crossovers were significantly enriched with the Stowaway
              family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs).
              The occupancy of Stowaway elements in gene promoters is
              concomitant with an increase in recombination rate. A generalized
              linear model identified the presence of Stowaway elements as the
              third most important genomic or chromatin feature behind genes and
              open chromatin for predicting crossover formation over 10-kb
              windows. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results suggest that
              meiotic crossovers in potato are largely determined by the local
              chromatin status, marked by accessible chromatin, H3K4me3-modified

              architectures has always been a hot topic in those two research

              role in the past decade, and it has been used widely in relevant
              genetic analyses owing to its flexible model assumptions on the
              unknown genetic architecture of complex traits. To fully utilize

               calling, phasing, and imputing sequence data of any coverage in
               small or large pedigrees. Our method, called hybrid peeling, uses
               multi-locus iterative peeling to estimate shared chromosome
               segments between parents and their offspring at a subset of loci,
               and then uses single-locus iterative peeling to aggregate genomic
               information across multiple generations at the remaining loci.
               RESULTS: Using a synthetic dataset, we first analysed the
               performance of hybrid peeling for calling and phasing genotypes
               in disconnected families, which contained only a focal individual
               and its parents and grandparents. Second, we analysed the
               performance of hybrid peeling for calling and phasing genotypes
               in the context of a full general pedigree. Third, we analysed the
               performance of hybrid peeling for imputing whole-genome sequence
               data to non-sequenced individuals in the population. We found
               that hybrid peeling substantially increased the number of called
               and phased genotypes by leveraging sequence information on
               related individuals. The calling rate and accuracy increased when
               the full pedigree was used compared to a reduced pedigree of just

               accurately whole-genome sequence to non-sequenced individuals.

               data in many pedigreed populations. We make this algorithm

               commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It
               includes, among others, (generalized) linear models,
               (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state
               space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and
               spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and
               geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate
               Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive
               regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field
               is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with
               non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not
               available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response
               variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can
               be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of
               both convergence and computational time. In some practical
               applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov
               chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for
               routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested
               Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly
               compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals.
               The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where
               Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run,
               our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or
               minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality,
               which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an
               automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison
               criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be
               compared and the model under study can be challenged.",

              other vertebrates. To gain a broader comparative perspective, we
              focused on the zebra finch (Taeniopygia castanotis), which, like
              other birds, differs from mammals in its karyotype (which includes
              many micro-chromosomes), in the mechanism by which recombination
              is directed to the genome, and in aspects of ontogenesis. We
              collected genome sequences from three generation pedigrees that
              provide information about 80 meioses, inferring 202 single-point
              de novo mutations, 1,174 crossovers, and 275 non-crossovers. On
              that basis, we estimated a sex-averaged mutation rate of 5.0
              \texttimes{} 10-9 per base pair per generation, on par with
              mammals that have a similar generation time. Also as in mammals,
              we found a paternal germline mutation bias at later stages of
              gametogenesis (of 1.7 to 1) but no discernible difference between
              sexes in early development. We also examined recombination
              patterns, and found that the sex-averaged crossover rate on
              macro-chromosomes (1.05 cM/Mb) is again similar to values observed
              in mammals, as is the spatial distribution of crossovers, with a
              pronounced enrichment near telomeres. In contrast, non-crossover
              rates are more uniformly distributed. On micro-chromosomes,
              sex-averaged crossover rates are substantially higher (4.21
              cM/Mb), as expected from crossover homeostasis, and both crossover
              and non-crossover events are more uniformly distributed. At a
              finer scale, recombination events overlap CpG islands more often
              than expected by chance, as expected in the absence of PRDM9.
              Despite differences in the mechanism by which recombination events
              are specified and the presence of many micro-chromosomes,
              estimates of the degree of GC-biased gene conversion (59\%), the
              mean non-crossover conversion tract length (~23 bp), and the
              non-crossover to crossover ratio (6.7:1) are all comparable to
              those reported in primates and mice. The conservation of mutation
              and recombination properties from zebra finch to mammals suggest
              that these processes have evolved under stabilizing selection.",

               increases the potential for local adaptation. Hybridization may
               also affect adaptation through altering sexual dimorphism and
               sexual conflict, but this remains largely unstudied. Here, we
               discuss how hybridization may affect sexual dimorphism and
               conflict due to differential effects of hybridization on males
               and females, and then how this, in turn, may affect local
               adaptation. First, in species with heterochromatic sexes, the
               lower viability of the heterogametic sex in hybrids could shift
               the balance in sexual conflict. Second, sex-specific inheritance
               of the mitochondrial genome in hybrids may lead to cytonuclear
               mismatches, for example, in the form of 'mother's curse', with
               potential consequences for sex ratio and sex-specific expression.

               reduce sexual conflict and enhance intersexual niche

               introgression of alleles reducing sexual conflict or enhancing

              Traits like age and age-dependent morphology have been shown to be
              important for the distribution of MP. However, most studies fail
              to separate between the different processes underlying age-effects

              probability for certain phenotypes) versus individually plastic
              changes in morphology and mating behaviour with age. Using
              Bayesian multi-level path analysis on a long-term dataset from a
              house sparrow (Passer domesticus) metapopulation, we disentangle
              the effects of age on male and female MP, both independently from
              and through morphological traits. Age was a key determinant of MP
              for males when accounting for morphological traits, with males
              having MP more often as they get older (plastic component of age)
              and not due to disappearance of males unsuccessful to get MP
              (selective disappearance), challenging `good genes' explanations

              levels of MP in older females, suggesting that higher quality

              an appropriate statistical decomposition of age-components and

               maps for the hihi or stitchbird (Notiomystis cincta), utilising

               Heterochiasmy in the hihi is male-biased, in line with

               being 15\% longer. Micro-chromosomes exhibit heterochiasmy to a

               regulating numerous cellular processes, such as chromosome
               segregation during mitosis. According to bioinformatics research,

               biological mechanism that CENPF operates in CC remains unclear.
               The aim of this study was to analyze the function of CENPF on
               cervical cancer and its mechanism. We conducted
               immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to examine the
               expression levels of CENPF in both cervical cancer tissues and
               cells. To explore the hidden biological function of CENPF in cell
               lines derived from CC, we applied lentivirus transfection to
               reduce CENPF manifestation. CENPF's main role is to regulate
               ferroptosis which was assessed by analyzing Reactive Oxygen
               Species (ROS), malonaldehyde (MDA), etc. The vitro findings were

               lines in the carcinomas of the cervix. In vitro and vivo

               suppression of CENPF can impede cellular multiplication,

               ferroptosis induced by CENPF inhibition in cervical cancer cell

              post-speciation divergence. To address these questions, we
              assembled 346 centromeres from 66 Arabidopsis thaliana and 2
              Arabidopsis lyrata accessions, which exhibited a remarkable degree
              of intra- and inter-species diversity. A. thaliana centromere
              repeat arrays are embedded in linkage blocks, despite ongoing
              internal satellite turnover, consistent with roles for
              unidirectional gene conversion or unequal crossover between sister
              chromatids in sequence diversification. Additionally, centrophilic

              often presenting the most striking contrasts. Despite the
              recognition that the sexes recombine at different rates
              (heterochiasmy), existing data fail to answer the question of
              whether patterns of genetic variation in recombination rate are
              similar in the two sexes. To fill this gap, we measured the
              genome-wide recombination rate in both sexes from a panel of
              wild-derived inbred strains from multiple subspecies of house mice
              (Mus musculus) and from a few additional species of Mus. To
              directly compare recombination rates in females and males from the
              same genetic backgrounds, we applied established methods based on
              immunolocalization of recombination proteins to inbred strains.
              Our results reveal discordant patterns of genetic variation in the
              two sexes. Whereas male genome-wide recombination rates vary
              substantially among strains, female recombination rates measured
              in the same strains are more static. The direction of
              heterochiasmy varies within two subspecies, Mus musculus

               whether the effect of inbreeding varies between chromosomes.
               Under the assumption that within an individual the probability of

               used a multi-membership model to estimate the deviation of

  abstract  = "The genetic architecture of traits under selection has important
               consequences for the response to selection and potentially for
               population viability. Early QTL mapping studies in wild
               populations have reported loci with large effect on trait
               variation. However, these results are contradicted by more recent
               genome-wide association analyses, which strongly support the idea
               that most quantitative traits have a polygenic basis. This study
               aims to re-evaluate the genetic architecture of a key
               morphological trait, birth weight, in a wild population of red
               deer (Cervus elaphus), using genomic approaches. A previous study
               using 93 microsatellite and allozyme markers and linkage mapping
               on a kindred of 364 deer detected a pronounced QTL on chromosome
               21 explaining 29\% of the variance in birth weight, suggesting
               that this trait is partly controlled by genes with large effects.
               Here, we used data for more than 2,300 calves genotyped at
               >39,000 SNP markers and two approaches to characterise the
               genetic architecture of birth weight. First, we performed a
               genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, using a genomic
               relatedness matrix to account for population structure. We found
               no SNPs significantly associated with birth weight. Second, we
               used genomic prediction to estimate the proportion of variance
               explained by each SNP and chromosome. This analysis confirmed
               that most genetic variance in birth weight was explained by loci
               with very small effect sizes. Third, we found that the proportion
               of variance explained by each chromosome was slightly positively
               correlated with its size. These three findings highlight a highly
               polygenic architecture for birth weight, which contradicts the
               previous QTL study. These results are probably explained by the
               differences in how associations are modelled between QTL mapping
               and GWA. Our study suggests that models of polygenic adaptation
               are the most appropriate to study the evolutionary trajectory of
               this trait.",

              basis; however, selection on these traits often differs between
              the sexes, leading to sexual conflict. Under such sexual
              antagonism, theory predicts the evolution of genetic architectures
              that resolve this sexual conflict. Yet, despite intense
              theoretical and empirical interest, the specific loci underlying
              sexually antagonistic phenotypes have rarely been identified,
              limiting our understanding of how sexual conflict impacts genome
              evolution and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Here we
              identify a large effect locus controlling age at maturity in
              Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), an important fitness trait in which
              selection favours earlier maturation in males than females, and
              show it is a clear example of sex-dependent dominance that reduces
              intralocus sexual conflict and maintains adaptive variation in
              wild populations. Using high-density single nucleotide
              polymorphism data across 57 wild populations and whole genome
              re-sequencing, we find that the vestigial-like family member 3
              gene (VGLL3) exhibits sex-dependent dominance in salmon, promoting
              earlier and later maturation in males and females, respectively.
              VGLL3, an adiposity regulator associated with size and age at
              maturity in humans, explained 39\% of phenotypic variation, an
              unexpectedly large proportion for what is usually considered a
              highly polygenic trait. Such large effects are predicted under
              balancing selection from either sexually antagonistic or spatially
              varying selection. Our results provide the first empirical example
              of dominance reversal allowing greater optimization of phenotypes
              within each sex, contributing to the resolution of sexual conflict
              in a major and widespread evolutionary trade-off between age and
              size at maturity. They also provide key empirical evidence for how
              variation in reproductive strategies can be maintained over large
              geographical scales. We anticipate these findings will have a
              substantial impact on population management in a range of
              harvested species where trends towards earlier maturation have
              been observed.",

              rates have not been found among non-social species from this
              insect order. It is unknown whether elevated recombination rates
              are a ubiquitous feature of all social insects. In many metazoan
              taxa, recombination is mainly restricted to hotspots a few
              kilobases in length. However, little is known about the prevalence
              of recombination hotspots in insect genomes. Here we infer
              recombination rate and its fine-scale variation across the genomes
              of two social species from the insect order Blattodea: the
              termites Cryptotermes secundus and Macrotermes bellicosus . We
              used linkage-disequilibrium-based methods to infer recombination
              rate. We infer that recombination rates are less than 1 cM/Mb in
              both species, which is lower than the average metazoan rate. We
              also observed a highly punctate distribution of recombination in

              resequencing of 97 grey wolves (Canis lupus) from the highly
              inbred Scandinavian wolf population to identify
              'identical-by-descent' (IBD) chromosome segments as runs of

              precisely measure realized inbreeding as the IBD fraction of the
              genome in ROH (F ROH). We found a striking pattern of complete or
              near-complete homozygosity of entire chromosomes in many
              individuals. The majority of individual inbreeding was due to long
              IBD segments (>5 cM) originating from ancestors $\leq{}$10

              is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic

              compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always
              an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and

              estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the

              Mexican tetra Astyanax mexicanus, no inactivating mutations have
              been found in any of these genes. Here, we show that excess DNA
              methylation-based epigenetic silencing promotes eye degeneration
              in blind cave A. mexicanus. By performing parallel analyses in A.
              mexicanus cave and surface morphs, and in the zebrafish Danio
              rerio, we have discovered that DNA methylation mediates
              eye-specific gene repression and globally regulates early eye
              development. The most significantly hypermethylated and
              downregulated genes in the cave morph are also linked to human eye
              disorders, suggesting that the function of these genes is
              conserved across vertebrates. Our results show that changes in DNA
              methylation-based gene repression can serve as an important
              molecular mechanism generating phenotypic diversity during
              development and evolution.",

              phenotypic differences that are not under strong selection, and
              changes in the environment, which may reflect evolutionary changes
              in the organisms themselves. As understanding of genetics
              developed after 1900, the new genetic discoveries were
              incorporated into evolutionary biology. The resulting general

              responses may occur in the wild. However, there are remarkably few
              cases where direct observations of natural populations have
              revealed microevolutionary changes occurring, despite the frequent

              paradox is that a genetic response to selection may be masked by
              opposing changes in the environment. We used data from a 20-year
              study of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) to explore
              selection on, and evolution of, a heritable trait: relative body

              model) of condition, the mean phenotypic value of this trait in

              Here we show that, despite this decline, the mean breeding value

              be explained by environmental deterioration, concealing underlying

              genome of the sexes, reflected in the B matrix of genetic
              intersexual covariances. To investigate the totality of forces
              shaping dimorphism, we reparameterized the Lande equation to
              predict changes in trait averages and trait differences between
              the sexes. As genetic constraints on the evolution of dimorphism
              in response to antagonistic selection become larger, dimorphism
              will tend to respond more rapidly to concordant selection (which
              favors the same direction of change in male and female traits)
              than to antagonistic selection. When we apply this theory to four
              empirical estimates of B in Drosophila melanogaster, the indirect
              responses of dimorphism to concordant selection are of comparable

              antagonistic selection in two suites of traits with typical levels

              pathogen, resulting in ongoing cycles of reciprocal adaptation
              between the antagonists. Such coevolutionary interactions have a
              central influence on the evolution of organisms. Surprisingly, we

              approach with an animal host to dissect coevolutionary selection.
              We find that distinct selective processes underlie rapid
              coadaptation in the two antagonists, including antagonistic
              frequency-dependent selection on toxin gene copy number in the
              pathogen, while the host response is likely influenced by changes

              coevolutionary interactions using an experimental host--pathogen
              model, which includes the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and its
              pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. We combined experimental
              evolution with time-shift experiments, in which a focal host or
              pathogen is tested against a coevolved antagonist from the past,
              present, or future, followed by genomic analysis. We show that (i)
              coevolution occurs rapidly within few generations, (ii) temporal
              coadaptation at the phenotypic level is found in parallel across
              replicate populations, consistent with antagonistic

              pathogen match the phenotypic pattern and include copy number
              variations of a toxin-encoding plasmid, and (iv) host genomic
              changes do not match the phenotypic pattern and likely involve
              selective responses at more than one locus. By exploring the
              dynamics of coevolution at the phenotypic and genomic level for
              both host and pathogen simultaneously, our findings demonstrate a
              more complex model of the Red Queen, consisting of distinct

              dynamics in randomly mating and inbreeding populations. We
              elucidate the influence of MGEs by examining the offspring

              adaptation of a polygenic trait. While population genetics views
              adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci
              underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective
              response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele
              frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is
              largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor each
              scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the architecture
              of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as resistance)
              with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis. The genetic
              structure of this trait allows for a full range of potential
              architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to small
              frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a newly
              devised analytical framework based on Yule branching processes, we
              gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation dynamics for this
              trait. Our key analytical result is an expression for the joint
              distribution of mutant alleles at the end of the adaptive phase.
              This distribution characterizes the polygenic pattern of
              adaptation at the underlying genotype when phenotypic adaptation
              has been accomplished. We find that a single compound parameter,
              the population-scaled background mutation rate $\Theta$bg,
              explains the main differences among these patterns. For a focal
              locus, $\Theta$bg measures the mutation rate at all redundant loci
              in its genetic background that offer alternative ways for
              adaptation. For adaptation starting from mutation-selection-drift
              balance, we observe different patterns in three parameter regions.
              Adaptation proceeds by sweeps for small $\Theta$bg ≲ 0.1, while
              small polygenic allele frequency shifts require large $\Theta$bg ≳
              100. In the large intermediate regime, we observe a heterogeneous

              selection on a highly polygenic trait in a diploid population of
              finite size. First, we derived the equilibrium distribution of the
              allele frequencies of the multilocus model by diffusion
              approximation. This formula describing the equilibrium allele
              frequencies as a mutation-selection-drift balance was examined by
              computer simulation using parameter values inferred for human
              height, a well-studied polygenic trait. Second, assuming that a
              sudden environmental shift of the fitness optimum occurs while the
              population is in equilibrium, we analyzed the adaptation of the
              trait to the new optimum. The speed at which the trait mean
              approaches the new optimum increases with the equilibrium genetic
              variance. Thus, large population size and/or large mutation rate
              may facilitate rapid adaptation. Third, the contribution of an
              individual locus i to polygenic adaptation depends on the compound
              parameter $\gamma$ i p i 0 q i 0 , where $\gamma$ i is the effect
              size, p i 0 the equilibrium frequency of the trait-increasing
              allele of this locus, and q i 0 = 1 - p i 0 . Thus, only loci with
              large values of this parameter contribute coherently to polygenic
              adaptation. Given that mutation rates are relatively small, this
              is more likely in large populations, in which the effects of drift
              are limited.",

               population size. The empirical support for this prediction is
               mixed: DNA markers usually reveal low heterozygosity in small
               populations, whereas quantitative traits show reduced
               heritability only in the smallest and most inbred populations.
               Quantitative variation can even increase in bottlenecked
               populations although this effect seems unlikely to increase the
               adaptive potential of populations. Second, individuals in small

              conducted in specially created crosses, in which genetic
              differences between parental lines are identified by linkage
              analysis. Detecting QTL segregating within populations is more
              problematic, especially in wild populations, because these

              selection, alleles enhancing a particular trait are predicted to
              become fixed within a population, leading to a decrease in the
              underlying genetic variation. However, there is often considerable
              genetic variation underlying sexually selected traits in wild
              populations, and consequently, this phenomenon has become a
              long-discussed issue in the field of evolutionary biology. In wild
              Soay sheep, large horns confer an advantage in strong intra-sexual
              competition, yet males show an inherited polymorphism for horn
              type and have substantial genetic variation in their horn size.
              Here we show that most genetic variation in this trait is
              maintained by a trade-off between natural and sexual selection at
              a single gene, relaxin-like receptor 2 (RXFP2). We found that an

              confers increased survival, resulting in a net effect of
              overdominance (that is, heterozygote advantage) for fitness at
              RXFP2. The nature of this trade-off is simple relative to commonly

              traits, such as genic capture ('good genes') and sexually

              and empirical attention, less is known about how recombination
              rate itself evolves and what influence this has on evolutionary

              the patterns of, and processes governing recombination in

              current knowledge with an analysis of linkage map data in 353
              organisms. We then discuss proximate and ultimate processes
              governing recombination rate variation and consider how these
              influence evolutionary processes. Genome-wide recombination rates
              (cM/Mb) can vary more than tenfold across eukaryotes, and there is
              large variation in the distribution of recombination events across
              closely related taxa, populations and individuals. We discuss how
              variation in rate and distribution relates to genome architecture,
              genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, sex, environmental
              perturbations and variable selective pressures. There has been

              information in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) to
              investigate the genetic architecture of individual autosomal
              recombination rates. Individual rates were high relative to other
              mammal systems and were higher in males than in females (autosomal

              In females, 46.7\% of the heritable variation was explained by a
              subtelomeric region on chromosome 6; a genome-wide association

              for horn type in both sexes, with males presenting with either
              large, normal horns or small, deformed horns (scurs). In addition,
              there is additive genetic variation in horn length among males

              major gene effects are expected to an even greater degree than for
              other adaptive traits. The likelihood of large adaptive peak
              shifts in mimicry evolution may therefore promote speciation. In
              addition, mimicry adaptive peaks are determined by the local
              abundance of particular patterns and may be more fluid than the

              extent to which DNA degradation affects SNP genotyping success and
              allele frequency estimation is not well understood. We conducted
              high density SNP genotyping and allele frequency estimation in
              both individual DNA samples and pooled DNA samples extracted from
              dried Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) scales stored at room
              temperature for up to 35 years, and assessed genotyping success,
              repeatability and accuracy of allele frequency estimation using a
              high density SNP genotyping array. RESULTS: In individual DNA
              samples, genotyping success and repeatability was very high (>
              0.973 and > 0.998, respectively) in samples stored for up to 35
              years; both increased with the proportion of DNA of fragment size
              > 1000 bp. In pooled DNA samples, allele frequency estimation was
              highly repeatable (Repeatability = 0.986) and highly correlated
              with empirical allele frequency measures (Mean Adjusted R2 =
              0.991); allele frequency could be accurately estimated in > 95\%
              of pooled DNA samples with a reference group of at least 30
              individuals. SNPs located in polyploid regions of the genome were
              more sensitive to DNA degradation: older samples had lower
              genotyping success at these loci, and a larger reference panel of
              individuals was required to accurately estimate allele
              frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: SNP genotyping was highly successful in
              degraded DNA samples, paving the way for the use of degraded
              samples in SNP genotyping projects. DNA pooling provides the
              potential for large scale population genetic studies with fewer

              provides a useful means to estimate fundamental population biology
              parameters relating to population demography, trait heritability
              and individual fitness when combined with other sources of data.
              However, there remain limitations to pedigree reconstruction in
              wild populations, particularly in systems where parent-offspring
              relationships cannot be directly observed, there is incomplete
              sampling of individuals, or molecular parentage inference relies
              on low quality DNA from archived material. While much can still be
              inferred from incomplete or sparse pedigrees, it is crucial to
              evaluate the quality and power of available genetic information a
              priori to testing specific biological hypotheses. Here, we used
              microsatellite markers to reconstruct a multi-generation pedigree
              of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) using archived scale
              samples collected with a total trapping system within a river over
              a 10 year period. Using a simulation-based approach, we determined
              the optimal microsatellite marker number for accurate parentage
              assignment, and evaluated the power of the resulting partial
              pedigree to investigate important evolutionary and quantitative
              genetic characteristics of salmon in the system. RESULTS: We show
              that at least 20 microsatellites (ave. 12 alleles/locus) are
              required to maximise parentage assignment and to improve the power
              to estimate reproductive success and heritability in this study
              system. We also show that 1.5 fold differences can be detected
              between groups simulated to have differing reproductive success,
              and that it is possible to detect moderate heritability values for
              continuous traits (h2 ~ 0.40) with more than 80\% power when using
              28 moderately to highly polymorphic markers. CONCLUSION: The
              methodologies and work flow described provide a robust approach
              for evaluating archived samples for pedigree-based research, even
              where only a proportion of the total population is sampled. The

              address challenging ecological and evolutionary questions in
              free-living populations, where genealogies can be traced only
              using molecular tools, and that significant increases in pedigree
              assignment power can be achieved by using higher numbers of

              potential of manipulating recombination rates to increase response
              to selection in livestock breeding programs. METHODS: We carried
              out ten replicates of several scenarios that followed a common
              overall structure but differed in the average rate of
              recombination along the genome (expressed as the length of a
              chromosome in Morgan), the genetic architecture of the trait under
              selection, and the selection intensity under truncation selection
              (expressed as the proportion of males selected). Recombination
              rates were defined by simulating nine different chromosome
              lengths: 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 Morgan,
              respectively. One Morgan was considered to be the typical
              chromosome length for current livestock species. The genetic
              architecture was defined by the number of quantitative trait
              variants (QTV) that affected the trait under selection. Either a
              large (10,000) or a small (1000 or 500) number of QTV was
              simulated. Finally, the proportions of males selected under
              truncation selection as sires for the next generation were equal
              to 1.2, 2.4, 5, or 10 \%. RESULTS: Increasing recombination rate
              increased the overall response to selection and decreased the loss
              of genetic variance. The difference in cumulative response between
              low and high recombination rates increased over generations. At
              low recombination rates, cumulative response to selection tended
              to asymptote sooner and the genetic variance was completely
              eroded. If the trait under selection was affected by few QTV,
              differences between low and high recombination rates still
              existed, but the selection limit was reached at all rates of
              recombination. CONCLUSIONS: Higher recombination rates can enhance
              the efficiency of breeding programs to turn genetic variation into
              response to selection. However, to increase response to selection
              significantly, the recombination rate would need to be increased
              10- or 20-fold. The biological feasibility and consequences of
              such large increases in recombination rates are unknown.",

              genetic architecture of individual autosomal recombination rate in

              matrices showed that ACC was heritable in females ([Formula: see
              text] = 0.12) but not in males. A regional heritability mapping
              approach showed that almost all heritable variation in female ACC
              was explained by a genomic region on deer linkage group 12

              lifetime reproductive success as a fitness measure. We show the
              trait is heritable and, thus, capable of responding to selection.
              The Breeder's Equation, which predicts microevolution as the
              product of phenotypic selection and heritability, predicted
              evolution of larger size. This was at odds, however, with the
              observed lack of either phenotypic or genetic temporal trends in
              body size, a so-called ``paradox of stasis.'' To investigate this

              change according to Robertson's secondary theorem of selection

              these responses vary over time, comes from humans, domesticated
              livestock or laboratory organisms. While the genetic basis of
              variation in immune responses have been investigated in these
              systems, there is a poor understanding of how genetic variation
              influences immunity in natural, untreated populations living in
              complex environments. Here, we examine the genetic architecture of
              variation in immune traits in the Soay sheep of St Kilda, an
              unmanaged population of sheep infected with strongyle
              gastrointestinal nematodes. We assayed IgA, IgE and IgG antibodies
              against the prevalent nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta in the
              blood plasma of > 3,000 sheep collected over 26 years. Antibody
              levels were significantly heritable (h2 = 0.21 to 0.57) and highly
              stable over an individual's lifespan. IgA levels were strongly
              associated with a region on chromosome 24 explaining 21.1\% and
              24.5\% of heritable variation in lambs and adults, respectively.
              This region was adjacent to two candidate loci, Class II Major
              Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator (CIITA) and C-Type
              Lectin Domain Containing 16A (CLEC16A). Lamb IgA levels were also
              associated with the immunoglobulin heavy constant loci (IGH)
              complex, and adult IgE levels and lamb IgA and IgG levels were
              associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This
              study provides evidence of high heritability of a complex
              immunological trait under natural conditions and provides the
              first evidence from a genome-wide study that large effect genes
              located outside the MHC region exist for immune traits in the

              evolutionary drivers and constraints at the genomic level. Antlers
              are a form of sexual weaponry in male red deer (Cervus elaphus).
              On the island of Rum, Scotland, males with larger antlers have
              increased breeding success, yet there has been no evidence of any
              response to selection at the genetic level. To try and understand

              limited haplotypic variation to identify a panel of SNPs that

              Infinium HD BeadChip. A panel of 11 SNPs could reliably determine

              meiosis that leads to the exchange of large segments of DNA
              between homologous chromosomes and is therefore an important
              driver of genetic diversity in populations. In breeding
              populations, understanding recombination is of particular interest
              because it can break up unfavourable linkage phases between
              alleles and produce novel combinations of alleles that could be
              exploited in selection. In this study, we used dense single
              nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data and pedigree
              information to analyse individual and sex-specific variation and
              genetic architecture of recombination rates within and between
              five commercially selected pig breeds. RESULTS: In agreement with
              previous studies, recombination rates were higher in females than
              in males for all breeds and for all chromosomes, except 1 and 13,
              for which male rates were slightly higher. Total recombination
              rate differed between breeds but the pattern of recombination
              along the chromosomes was well conserved across breeds for the
              same sex. The autosomal linkage maps spanned a total length of
              1731 to 1887 cM for males and of 2231 to 2515 cM for females.
              Estimates of heritability for individual autosomal crossover count
              ranged from 0.04 to 0.07 for males and from 0.08 to 0.11 for
              females. Fourteen genomic regions were found to be associated with
              individual autosomal crossover count. Of these, four were close to
              or within candidate genes that have previously been associated
              with individual recombination rates in pigs and other mammals,
              namely RNF212, SYCP2 and MSH4. Two of the identified regions
              included the PRDM7 and MEI1 genes, which are known to be involved
              in meiosis but have not been previously associated with variation
              in individual recombination rates. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows
              that genetic variation in autosomal recombination rate persists in
              domesticated species under strong selection, with differences
              between closely-related breeds and marked differences between the
              sexes. Our findings support results from other studies, i.e., that
              individual crossover counts are associated with the RNF212, SYCP2
              and MSH4 genes in pig. In addition, we have found two novel
              candidate genes associated with the trait, namely PRDM7 and MEI1.",

              ubiquitous across eukaryotic genomes. The effects of BGS reflect
              the interplay of the rates and fitness effects of deleterious
              mutations with recombination. A fundamental assumption of BGS
              models is that recombination rates are invariant over time.
              However, in some lineages recombination rates evolve rapidly,
              violating this central assumption. Here, we investigate how
              recombination rate evolution affects genetic variation under BGS.
              We show that recombination rate evolution modifies the effects of

              This has been interpreted as evidence either for a direct effect
              of recombination on fitness, or for the maintenance of linkage
              disequilibria by epistatic selection. Here we show that such a
              recombination load is to be expected even if selection favours
              increased genetic recombination. This is because of the fact that,
              although a modifier may suffer an immediate loss of fitness if it
              increases recombination, it eventually becomes associated with a
              higher additive genetic variance in fitness, which allows a faster
              response to direction selection. This argument applies to
              mutation-selection balance with synergistic epistasis, directional
              selection on quantitative traits, and ectopic exchange among
              transposable elements. Further experiments are needed to determine
              whether the selection against recombination due to the immediate
              load is outweighed by the increased additive variance in fitness

              advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite
              populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it
              breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic
              drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this
              randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci
              to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where
              there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is
              shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and
              Muller. It also predicts the ``ratchet mechanism'' discovered by
              Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more

              elusive. One popular hypothesis is that sex and recombination
              promote adaptation to a changing environment. The strongest
              evidence that increased recombination may evolve because
              recombination promotes adaptation comes from artificially selected
              populations. Recombination rates have been found to increase as a
              correlated response to selection on traits unrelated to
              recombination in several artificial selection experiments and in a
              comparison of domesticated and nondomesticated mammals. There are,
              however, several alternative explanations for the increase in
              recombination in such populations, including two different
              evolutionary explanations. The first is that the form of selection
              is epistatic, generating linkage disequilibria among selected
              loci, which can indirectly favor modifier alleles that increase
              recombination. The second is that random genetic drift in selected
              populations tends to generate disequilibria such that beneficial
              alleles are often found in different individuals; modifier alleles
              that increase recombination can bring together such favorable
              alleles and thus may be found in individuals with greater fitness.
              In this paper, we compare the evolutionary forces acting on
              recombination in finite populations subject to strong selection.
              To our surprise, we found that drift accounted for the majority of
              selection for increased recombination observed in simulations of
              small to moderately large populations, suggesting that, unless

              hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates
              (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences
              from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that
              the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal,
              with a mode at 0. This ``unimodal assumption'' (UA), although
              natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into
              standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it
              brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient
              and robust computation-estimating the unimodal distribution
              involves solving a simple convex optimization problem-and enables
              more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the
              method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect
              size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the
              one number usually used ($p$ value or $z$ score). When available,
              using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in
              measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation
              of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides
              interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition
              to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval
              estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term ``local
              false sign rate'' to refer to the probability of getting the sign
              of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of
              significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally
              applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are

              genotypes (genomic selection) has several advantages over
              phenotype-based selection but has, so far, seen very limited use
              outside animal and plant breeding. Genomic selection depends on
              the markers tagging the causal loci that underlie the selected
              trait. Because the number of necessary markers depends, among
              other factors, on effective population size, genomic selection may
              be in practice not feasible in wild populations as most wild
              populations have much higher effective population sizes than
              domesticated populations. However, the current possibilities of
              cost-effective high-throughput genotyping could overcome this
              limitation and thereby make it possible to apply genomic selection
              also in wild populations. Using a unique dataset of about 2000
              wild great tits (Parus major), a small passerine bird, genotyped
              on a 650 k SNP chip we calculated genomic breeding values for
              egg-laying date using the so-called GBLUP approach. In this
              approach, the pedigree-based relatedness matrix of an ``animal
              model,'' a special form of the mixed model, is replaced by a
              marker-based relatedness matrix. Using the marker-based
              relatedness matrix, the model seemed better able to disentangle
              genetic and permanent environmental effects. We calculated the
              accuracy of genomic breeding values by correlating them to the
              phenotypes of individuals whose phenotypes were excluded from the
              analysis when estimating the genomic breeding values. The obtained

              genomic relatedness estimator but a strong effect of the number of
              SNPs. The obtained accuracy is lower than typically seen in
              domesticated species but considerable for a trait with low
              heritability ($\sim{}$0.2) as avian breeding time. Our results

              drift, natural selection, and gene flow shape allele frequencies
              through time. However, the actual processes underlying these
              changes-variation in individual survival, reproductive success,
              and movement-are often difficult to quantify. Fully understanding
              these processes requires the population pedigree, the set of
              relationships among all individuals in the population through
              time. Here, we use extensive pedigree and genomic information from
              a long-studied natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays
              (Aphelocoma coerulescens) to directly characterize the relative
              roles of different evolutionary processes in shaping patterns of
              genetic variation through time. We performed gene dropping
              simulations to estimate individual genetic contributions to the
              population and model drift on the known pedigree. We found that
              observed allele frequency changes are generally well predicted by
              accounting for the different genetic contributions of founders.
              Our results show that the genetic contribution of recent
              immigrants is substantial, with some large allele frequency shifts
              that otherwise may have been attributed to selection actually due
              to gene flow. We identified a few SNPs under directional
              short-term selection after appropriately accounting for gene flow.
              Using models that account for changes in population size, we
              partitioned the proportion of variance in allele frequency change
              through time. Observed allele frequency changes are primarily due
              to variation in survival and reproductive success, with gene flow
              making a smaller contribution. This study provides one of the most
              complete descriptions of short-term evolutionary change in allele

              Differential fitness has been demonstrated in field studies of
              many organisms, but it remains unclear how well we can
              quantitatively predict allele frequency changes from fitness
              measurements. Here, we characterize natural selection on millions
              of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome of the
              annual plant Mimulus guttatus. We use fitness estimates to
              calibrate population genetic models that effectively predict
              allele frequency changes into the next generation. Hundreds of
              SNPs experienced ``male selection'' in 2013 with one allele at
              each SNP elevated in frequency among successful male gametes
              relative to the entire population of adults. In the following
              generation, allele frequencies at these SNPs consistently shifted
              in the predicted direction. A second year of study revealed that
              SNPs had effects on both viability and reproductive success with
              pervasive trade-offs between fitness components. SNPs favored by
              male selection were, on average, detrimental to survival. These
              trade-offs (antagonistic pleiotropy and temporal fluctuations in
              fitness) may be essential to the long-term maintenance of alleles.
              Despite the challenges of measuring selection in the wild, the
              strong correlation between predicted and observed allele frequency
              changes suggests that population genetic models have a much
              greater role to play in forward-time prediction of evolutionary

               two sexes (differing only in magnitude), limited to one sex, or
               in opposing directions (antagonistic). Attempts to detect the
               signal of sex-specific selection from genomic data have
               confronted numerous difficulties. These challenges highlight the
               utility of ``direct approaches,'' in which fitness is predicted
               from individual genotype within each sex. Here, we directly
               measured selection on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in a
               natural population of the sexually dimorphic, dioecious plant,
               Silene latifolia. We measured flowering phenotypes, estimated
               fitness over one reproductive season, as well as survival to the
               next year, and genotyped all adults and a subset of their
               offspring for SNPs across the genome. We found that while
               phenotypic selection was congruent (fitness covaried similarly
               with flowering traits in both sexes), SNPs showed clear evidence
               for sex-specific selection. SNP-level selection was particularly
               strong in males and may involve an important gametic component
               (e.g., pollen competition). While the most significant SNPs under
               selection in males differed from those under selection in
               females, paternity selection showed a highly polygenic tradeoff
               with female survival. Alleles that increased male mating success
               tended to reduce female survival, indicating sexual antagonism at
               the genomic level. Perhaps most importantly, this experiment
               demonstrates that selection within natural populations can be
               strong enough to measure sex-specific fitness effects of
               individual loci. Males and females typically differ
               phenotypically, a phenomenon known as sexual dimorphism. These
               differences arise when selection on males differs from selection
               on females, either in magnitude or direction. Estimated
               relationships between traits and fitness indicate that
               sex-specific selection is widespread, occurring in both plants
               and animals, and explains why so many species exhibit sexual
               dimorphism. Finding the specific loci experiencing sex-specific
               selection is a challenging prospect but one worth undertaking
               given the extensive evolutionary consequences. Flowering plants
               with separate sexes are ideal organisms for such studies, given
               that the fitness of females can be estimated by counting the
               number of seeds they produce. Determination of fitness for males
               has been made easier as thousands of genetic markers can now be
               used to assign paternity to seeds. We undertook just such a study
               in S. latifolia, a short-lived, herbaceous plant. We identified
               loci under sex-specific selection in this species and found more
               loci affecting fitness in males than females. Importantly, loci
               with major effects on male fitness were distinct from the loci
               with major effects on females. We detected sexual antagonism only
               when considering the aggregate effect of many loci. Hence, even
               though males and females share the same genome, this does not
               necessarily impose a constraint on their independent evolution.",

               Reciprocal local adaptation was pronounced for viability, but not
               for reproductive components of fitness. Instead, local genomes
               had a fecundity advantage only in the high latitude garden. By
               estimating realized selection coefficients from individual-level
               data on viability and reproductive success and permuting the data
               to infer significance, we examined the genetic basis of fitness
               trade-offs. This analytical approach (Conditional
               Neutrality-Antagonistic Pleiotropy, CNAP) identified genetic
               trade-offs at a flowering phenology QTL (costs of adaptation) and

               reproduction). These patterns would not have emerged from
               traditional ANOVA-based QTL mapping. Our analytical framework can
               be applied to other systems to investigate fitness trade-offs.
               This task is becoming increasingly important as climate change

              antagonistic genetic variants. To address these deficits, we use
              sex-specific fitness data from 202 fully sequenced hemiclonal
              Drosophila melanogaster fly lines to perform a genome-wide
              association study (GWAS) of sexual antagonism. We identify

               populations, individuals are often marked at one point in their
               life and then repeatedly recaptured. It is therefore essential
               that a method for GWAS includes the process of repeated sampling.
               In a GWAS, the effects of thousands of single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs) need to be fitted and any model development
               is constrained by the computational requirements. A method is
               therefore required that can fit a highly hierarchical model and
               at the same time is computationally fast enough to be useful.Our
               method fits fixed SNP effects in a linear mixed model that can
               include both random polygenic effects and permanent environmental
               effects. In this way, the model can correct for population
               structure and model repeated measures. The covariance structure
               of the linear mixed model is first estimated and subsequently
               used in a generalized least squares setting to fit the SNP
               effects. The method was evaluated in a simulation study based on
               observed genotypes from a long-term study of collared flycatchers
               in Sweden.The method we present here was successful in estimating
               permanent environmental effects from simulated repeated measures
               data. Additionally, we found that especially for variable

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RAD-seq is a powerful tool, increasingly used in
              population genomics. However, earlier studies have raised red
              flags regarding possible biases associated with this technique. In
              particular, polymorphism on restriction sites results in
              preferential sampling of closely related haplotypes, so that RAD
              data tends to underestimate genetic diversity. RESULTS: Here we
              (1) clarify the theoretical basis of this bias, highlighting the
              potential confounding effects of population structure and
              selection, (2) confront predictions to real data from in silico
              digestion of full genomes and (3) provide a proof of concept
              toward an ABC-based correction of the RAD-seq bias. Under a
              neutral and panmictic model, we confirm the previously established
              relationship between the true polymorphism and its RAD-based
              estimation, showing a more pronounced bias when polymorphism is
              high. Using more elaborate models, we show that selection,
              resulting in heterogeneous levels of polymorphism along the
              genome, exacerbates the bias and leads to a more pronounced
              underestimation. On the contrary, spatial genetic structure tends
              to reduce the bias. We confront the neutral and panmictic model to
              ``ideal'' empirical data (in silico RAD-sequencing) using full
              genomes from natural populations of the fruit fly Drosophila
              melanogaster and the fungus Shizophyllum commune, harbouring
              respectively moderate and high genetic diversity. In D.
              melanogaster, predictions fit the model, but the small difference
              between the true and RAD polymorphism makes this comparison
              insensitive to deviations from the model. In the highly
              polymorphic fungus, the model captures a large part of the bias
              but makes inaccurate predictions. Accordingly, ABC corrections
              based on this model improve the estimations, albeit with some
              imprecisions. CONCLUSION: The RAD-seq underestimation of genetic
              diversity associated with polymorphism in restriction sites
              becomes more pronounced when polymorphism is high. In practice,
              this means that in many systems where polymorphism does not exceed
              2 \%, the bias is of minor importance in the face of other sources
              of uncertainty, such as heterogeneous bases composition or
              technical artefacts. The neutral panmictic model provides a
              practical mean to correct the bias through ABC, albeit with some
              imprecisions. More elaborate ABC methods might integrate
              additional parameters, such as population structure and selection,
              but their opposite effects could hinder accurate corrections.",

               depths too low to confidently call individual genotypes, lcWGS
               requires specialized analysis tools that explicitly account for
               genotype uncertainty. A growing number of such tools have become
               available, but it can be difficult to get an overview of what
               types of analyses can be performed reliably with lcWGS data, and
               how the distribution of sequencing effort between the number of
               samples analysed and per-sample sequencing depths affects
               inference accuracy. In this introductory guide to lcWGS, we first
               illustrate how the per-sample cost for lcWGS is now comparable to
               RAD-seq and Pool-seq in many systems. We then provide an overview
               of software packages that explicitly account for genotype
               uncertainty in different types of population genomic inference.
               Next, we use both simulated and empirical data to assess the

               disequilibrium estimation, detection of population structure, and
               selection scans under different sequencing strategies. Our
               results show that spreading a given amount of sequencing effort
               across more samples with lower depth per sample consistently
               improves the accuracy of most types of inference, with a few
               notable exceptions. Finally, we assess the potential for using
               imputation to bolster inference from lcWGS data in nonmodel
               species, and discuss current limitations and future perspectives
               for lcWGS-based population genomics research. With this overview,
               we hope to make lcWGS more approachable and stimulate its broader

               be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human
               variability. The great body of available statistics show us that
               the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very
               closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the
               variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation
               corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When

               on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the

               expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose

               traits, such as reproduction. The fitness costs and benefits of
               an immune response are likely to depend on host age, sex, and
               levels of parasite exposure. Few studies have examined the full
               extent to which patterns of natural selection on immune
               phenotypes vary across demographic groups and environments in the
               wild. Here, we assessed natural selection on plasma levels of
               three functionally distinct isotypes (IgA, IgE, and IgG) of
               antibodies against a prevalent nematode parasite measured in a
               wild Soay sheep population over 26 years. We found little support
               for environment-dependent selection or reproductive costs.
               However, antibody levels were negatively associated with parasite
               egg counts and positively associated with subsequent survival,
               albeit in a highly age- and isotype-dependent manner. Raised
               levels of antiparasite IgA best predicted reduced egg counts, but
               this did not predict survival in lambs. In adults increased
               antiparasite IgG predicted reduced egg counts, and in adult
               females IgG levels also positively predicted overwinter survival.
               Our results highlight the potential importance of age- and
               sex-dependent selection on immune phenotypes in nature and show
               that patterns of selection can vary even among functionally

              quantitative traits in wild populations. Is trait variation
              influenced by many genes of small effect or by a few genes of
              major effect? Where is additive genetic variation located in the
              genome? Do the same loci cause similar phenotypic variation in
              different populations? Great tits (Parus major) have been studied
              extensively in long-term studies across Europe and consequently
              are considered an ecological 'model organism'. Recently, genomic
              resources have been developed for the great tit, including a
              custom SNP chip and genetic linkage map. In this study, we used a
              suite of approaches to investigate the genetic architecture of
              eight quantitative traits in two long-term study populations of
              great tits--one in the Netherlands and the other in the United
              Kingdom. Overall, we found little evidence for the presence of
              genes of large effects in either population. Instead, traits
              appeared to be influenced by many genes of small effect, with
              conservative estimates of the number of contributing loci ranging
              from 31 to 310. Despite concordance between population-specific
              heritabilities, we found no evidence for the presence of loci
              having similar effects in both populations. While
              population-specific genetic architectures are possible, an
              undetected shared architecture cannot be rejected because of
              limited power to map loci of small and moderate effects. This
              study is one of few examples of genetic architecture analysis in
              replicated wild populations and highlights some of the challenges
              and limitations researchers will face when attempting similar

  abstract = "In many eukaryotes, meiotic recombination occurs preferentially at
              discrete sites, called recombination hotspots. In various
              lineages, recombination hotspots are located in regions with
              promoter-like features and are evolutionarily stable. Conversely,
              in some mammals, hotspots are driven by PRDM9 that targets
              recombination away from promoters. Paradoxically, PRDM9 induces
              the self-destruction of its targets and this triggers an
              ultra-fast evolution of mammalian hotspots. PRDM9 is ancestral to
              all animals, suggesting a critical importance for the meiotic
              program, but has been lost in many lineages with surprisingly
              little effect on meiosis success. However, it is unclear whether
              the function of PRDM9 described in mammals is shared by other
              species. To investigate this, we analyzed the recombination
              landscape of several salmonids, the genome of which harbors one
              full-length PRDM9 and several truncated paralogs. We identified
              recombination initiation sites in Oncorhynchus mykiss by mapping
              meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We found that DNA DSBs
              clustered at hotspots positioned away from promoters, enriched for
              the H3K4me3 and H3K4me36 marks and the location of which depended
              on the genotype of full-length Prdm9. We observed a high level of
              polymorphism in the zinc finger domain of full-length Prdm9, but
              not of the truncated paralogs. Moreover, population-scaled
              recombination maps in O. mykiss, Oncorhynchus kisutch and Salmo
              salar revealed a rapid turnover of recombination hotspots caused
              by PRDM9 target motif erosion. Our results imply that PRDM9
              function is conserved across vertebrates and that the peculiar
              evolutionary runaway caused by PRDM9 has been active for several
              hundred million years.",

              or form even though such changes significantly reduce the
              fertility of hybrid intermediates. We have addressed this
              evolutionary paradox by expanding the principle that nonrandom
              segregation of chromosomes takes place whenever human or mouse
              females are heterozygous carriers of Robertsonian translocations,
              a common form of chromosome rearrangement in mammals. Our analysis
              of 1170 mammalian karyotypes provides strong evidence that
              karyotypic evolution is driven by nonrandom segregation during
              female meiosis. The pertinent variable in this form of meiotic
              drive is the presence of differing numbers of centromeres on
              paired homologous chromosomes. This situation is encountered in
              all heterozygous carriers of Robertsonian translocations. Whenever
              paired chromosomes have different numbers of centromeres, the
              inherent asymmetry of female meiosis and the polarity of the
              meiotic spindle dictate that the partner with the greater number
              of centromeres will attach preferentially to the pole that is most
              efficient at capturing centromeres. This mechanism explains how
              chromosomal variants become fixed in populations, as well as why
              closely related species often appear to have evolved by
              directional adjustment of the karyotype toward or away from a
              particular chromosome form. If differences in the ability of
              particular DNA sequences or chromosomal regions to function as
              centromeres are also considered, nonrandom segregation is likely
              to affect karyotype evolution across a very broad phylogenetic
              range.",
