\subsection*{ESEB Abstract}

\subsubsection*{Background}
Meiotic recombination during gamete formation is a fundamental evolutionary process. It is required to ensure proper chromosome segregation and promotes genetic diversity by shuffling alleles into novel haplotypes. This can create beneficial allele combinations and break up linkage between beneficial and harmful alleles, thereby facilitating adaptive evolution. However, high recombination rates also carry risks, such as introducing mutations at crossover sites, and potentially disrupting favorable allele combinations. Thus, recombination rates could affect individual fitness in opposite directions, suggesting a complex relationship with individual fitness.

Investigating the impact of recombination rates on fitness is complicated by the fact that identifying crossover positions during meiosis - and thus finding the crossover count - is only possible for individuals with genotyped offspring. This introduces a sampling bias which prevents measuring the recombination rates of individuals that are reproductively unsuccessful, excluding them from potential fitness analyses. Failure to account for these unmeasured individuals could potentially bias analyses of the fitness effects of recombination rates.

\subsubsection*{Materials and methods}
We used a long-term house sparrow study system from northern Norway with extensive pedigree, genotype, and fitness data to investigate the relationship between individual recombination rates and fitness components. The genomic and pedigree data were leveraged to measure autosomal crossover count (ACC) in adult house sparrows, resulting in one ACC measure per genotyped parent-offspring pair. We estimated sex-specific individual breeding values for ACC by using the phenotypic ACC measures for each parent as responses in a genomic prediction model. The genomic prediction, implemented as a Bayesian G-BLUP model, allowed us to estimate these breeding values in more than 2,600 phenotyped individuals, as well as in more than 2,900 additional individuals with no recorded offspring, correcting the aforementioned sampling bias and increasing the sample size of the subsequent fitness analyses.

We then related the estimated breeding values to sex-specific fitness components, including annual reproductive success and annual survival. As the individuals without ACC measurements had higher uncertainty in their estimated breeding values, we used measurement error modelling to account for the heterogeneous breeding value uncertainties. 

\subsubsection*{Results}
We found that individual ACC was related to male and female annual survival, with predicted annual survival peaking at intermediate breeding values for individual ACC. We also found weak evidence that males with intermediate breeding values had higher annual recruit production, but no evidence of a relationship with reproductive success in females. Altogether these results suggest potential stabilizing selection against extreme values of ACC, especially in male house sparrows.

\subsubsection*{Conclusions}
We demonstrate that individual variation in recombination rates influences fitness in a wild house sparrow population, with evidence of stabilizing selection on ACC particularly in male house sparrows. To interpret this association, we consider possible underlying biological mechanisms. On the methodological side, we present genomic prediction as a tool to address sampling biases. This novel approach allowed us to investigate the fitness consequences of a trait that can only be directly measured in reproductively successful individuals and allowed us to include several thousand individuals in the analysis that would otherwise have been excluded.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{House sparrow dataset}
% THIS IS AN ALMOST DIRECT LIFTOVER FROM THE MBE PAPER

All data in this study was collected from a meta-population of house sparrows inhabiting an 18-island archipelago off the Helgeland coast in Northern Norway (midpoint of 66$^\circ$32`N, 12$^\circ$32`E and covering 1600km\textsuperscript{2}). This metapopulation has been subject to an individual-based long-term study since 1993 \citep{Jensen2004-wt}. Birds are routinely captured and individually marked from the beginning of May to the middle of August and for approximately one month in the autumn using mist nets (adults and fledged juveniles), or as fledglings in accessible nests during the breeding season. A small (25 $\mu$ l) blood sample is collected from the brachial vein for DNA from every captured bird. Individual hatch year was determined as either (a) the first year recorded for nestlings or fledged juveniles captured in the summer and autumn, or (b) the year prior to first year recorded for birds first captured as female adults before June 1 or as males before August 1, or (c) a range including the year first recorded and the year prior for birds first captured as adult females after June 1 or adult males after August 1; hatch island is also recorded alongside hatch year \citep{ranke2021spatial, Saatoglu2021-ya}. Sampling was conducted in strict accordance with permits from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Ringing Centre at Stavanger Museum, Norway.


\subsection*{Data}

\subsection*{Outline of analysis}

% Describe the general workflow here, before describing the details of each step in the subsections below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivate why GP \begin{itemize}
        \item The method for measuring ACC produces one measurement per genotyped parnet/offspring pair.
        \item Thus, missing CO measurements for non-successful breeders.
        \item But: can GP them
    \end{itemize}
    \item Outline GP
    \item Briefly describe feeding forward uncertainty
    \item Outline fitness models
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Genomic Prediction}

Given measurements of the crossover count $y_{ij}$ of individual $i$ (estimated from offspring $j$) we model
\begin{equation*}
    y_{ij} = \mu + \beta_\text{coverage} \cdot x_{\text{coverage},ij} + g_i + z_{\text{hy},i} + z_{\text{hi},i} + z_{\text{id},i} + z_{\varepsilon,ij}\ ,
\end{equation*}
where $\mu$ is an intercept, $\beta_\text{coverage}$ is the regression coefficient for total coverage $x_{\text{coverage},ij}$, $g_i$ is a structured random effect corresponding to the genetic value, and $z_{\text{hy},i}$, $z_{\text{hi},i}$, $z_{\text{id},i}$, and $z_{\varepsilon,ij}$ are unstructured random effects corresponding to hatch year, (known or presumed) hatch island, permanent environmental effects and residual environmental effects, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe model equation
    \item Describe GRM
\end{itemize}

The crossover count $y_{ij}$ is a count trait, but we treat it as continuous Gaussian.

priors on random effects: $PC(var = \hat{\sigma}^2_y / 2, 0.05)$ 

Fitting the GP model results in marginal posterior distributions for each breeding value. All of which approximately normal (can show by looking at QQ plots), so we can write
\begin{equation*}
    g_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Fitness analyses}

We investigate the impact of the breeding values for sex-specific breeding values on fitness components.

% Sentences Susan asked for:
The Bayesian GP models give us full joint posteriors for the breeding value vector $\bm g$.
In the fitness models, we can therefore incorporate the measurement error in these breeding value by sampling breeding values from these posterior distributions. 
Rather than treating the breeding values as having fixed, known values, we sample each breeding value $g_i$ in each MCMC iteration, and regress on these samples (and their square) in the logistic regression. 
(This is equivalent to assuming a Berkson measurement error model for the 
breeding values.)

\subsubsection*{Annual survival}

For individual $i$ in year $j$ we model the survival as a logistic GLMM, written here as a Bayesian hierarchical model:
\begin{align*}
    &g_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2) \\
    &\eta_{ij} = \alpha + \beta_g \cdot g_i + beta_{g^2} \cdot g_i^2 + \beta_\text{age} \cdot \text{age} + \beta_{\text{age}^2} \cdot \text{age}^2 + \beta_f \cdot f + \text{isl}_i + \text{year}_j + \text{id}_i + \varepsilon_{ij}\\
    &P(\text{survival}_{ij} = 1) = \text{logit}^{-1}(\eta_{ij})
\end{align*}
